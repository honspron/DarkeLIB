# Format of rsoul cmds is:
#	verb:flags:connector:adverb:option1:overb
#
# The standard printout format for a command is:
#	"You $(verb) [$(connector) <someone>] $(adverb)."
# Format flag 0 gives:
#	"You $(verb) $(adverb)."
# Format flag 1 gives:
#	"You $(verb) $(option1) [$(connector) <someone>] $(adverb)."
# Format flag 2 gives:
#	"You $(verb) $(connector) {$(option1)|<someone>} $(adverb)."
#
# The other flags (case sensitive) are:
#	A - apostophe's the target (e.g. "You $(verb) <someone>'s...")
#	E - environment variable by same name as cmd overrides adverb
#	F - force the adverb to be applied, in addition to any override
#	O - uses the objective variable
#	P - uses the possessive variable
#	S - uses the subjective variable
#	V - use the overb instead of verb for messages
#
# Note that it is necessary to include the *ive variable flags if you use
# the respective variables, or the messages will not be parsed for that
# variable.  This is done for efficiency purposes.
