I would like to apply to become a wizard.
As far as qualifications go, I've already done some building on another MUD, Envy/Mythran code, so I'm not totally inexperienced.
I don't know a great deal about Darkelib because I've only seen sections of the stock code from Darkelib 1.0.
From what I can tell, assuming it hasn't been added into the version we're running on here currently, there is no on-line creation and no building editors available in Darkelib, so building here is essentially coding.
I started trying to teach myself C and C++ a month or so ago, and from the source code I've seen for darkelib everything (creatures, rooms, objects, etc.) seems to have a fairly standardized format, so I'm fairly sure I could pick up on how to write things for the MUD without too much trouble.
