This is a cave complex, an entrance to an underdark and future drow city.
As of now, there are only 10 rooms, I will add as I go, as of right now I am
planning on keeping the monsters as tough as rogue.c mage.c and warrior.c but
I'm going to have some not gang bang and all monsters save perhaps a few
will be unable to see invisible, at least until I start on the city.
I find that if you have a monster, and players get burned by it, they become
reluctant to test it again.
Anyway, next step will be an underdark area, ripe with mid-high level monsters.
It should be noted that in rooms cave001-cave010 when you die you are
teleported to the church.  The entire area will be like this.  Also, if
you use shadow form, you will be teleported out.  I don't believe that people
who explore as ghosts or are immune to damage should be able to run rampant
in my area.  Then again, I can be a dik.
