To add random equipment generator to a mob:

1st: Add line to top of mob file
      inherit "/wizards/maxwell/objects/mon/mob_eq2";

2nd: Add this somewhere in create();
      //Equipment Code
      mob = this_object();
      wield_hand = "right hand";
      
3rd: Use reset() in room to call equipment
      mon->weapon_code_midlevel();
      mon->armour_code_midlevel();
