The wizzes/admins at __________________ are a bunch of...
	__ power-mad a**holes
	__ dictators
	__ Nazis
	__ Fascists
	__ Hippocrites
	__ Hippos
	__ Racists
	__ Losers with nothing better to do than MU*
	__ Cold-hearted axe-murderers
	__ All of the above
	__ None of the above
	__ I don't know
	__ What's 'a**hole' mean?
They...
	__ toaded/nuked/killed/banned me
	__ booted me
	__ directly lied to me
	__ took away all my xp
	__ scolded me
	__ made faces at me
	__ called me names like 'completely clueless utter moron'

because...
	__ I thought that they could take an infinite amount of verbal abuse.
	__ I thought it was to okay hack at their server to try to break it.
			__ Check here if you wish to use the usual, "I was just
				testing their security for them" excuse.
	__ I love of sound of my voice, and assumed that nobody would object
		to my constant vulgar shouts.
	__ I thought that my position on the helpstaff gave me the right to
		engage in behavior that would get anyone else thrown out.
			__ Check here if "everybody else does it".
	__ I very kindly let a banned player use my character to sneak back
		into the game.
	__ I gave my blood, sweat, tears, and my left arm to that MU* to
		make it what it is today, and damn it, it's just a moral
		outrage that a mad emperor can do that to me, and I will spend
		the rest of my life seeking justice for that perpetrator, this to
		you I swear!
	__ I really can't tell the difference between VR and RL, and assumed
		that someone who loves me in the game must also love me in RL,
		which means that it's okay to stalk them and make death threats if
		they don't return my love.
			__ Check here if you were virtually sexually assaulted.
	__ I was mad at/just broke up with...
			__ my husband/wife,
			__ my boyfriend/girlfriend,
			__ someone who trusted me,
		and used their password to log into their character and...
			__ recycle all of their belongings.
			__ obscenely redescribe all of their belongings.
			__ destroy their reputation by breaking every rule I could.
	__ I am really proud of the explicit description I wrote for my
		genitals, and I assumed that everyone would enjoy the sight of
		them in public.
	__ I know those rules and policies I agreed to when I joined the game
		 are really for everyone else, not me.
	__ I tried to show the admin how he was logically inconsistent by
		calling him a "self-absorbed, hypocritical, power-mad little
		bastard who couldn't code his way out of a paper bag"
	__ I was trying to make the MU* a better place.

I now plan to...
	__ go from site to site, whining to everyone about how badly I
		was treated after I got caught.
	__ convince all of my friends (3 in all) to leave their site, causing
		their MU* to shut down forever.
	__ mail the site admin, informing him as a Friend of the Net that
		Nazis have infiltrated his site.
	__ get a new character from another email address, so I can get back
		in and resume my obnoxious activities.
			__ Check here if you plan to wait a couple of months, hoping
				they'll relax their vigilance.
	__ start a new and unique flamewar, about how unfair MU* admins are.
	__ become a guest on the daytime talk show circuit
	__ spend more time in RL
