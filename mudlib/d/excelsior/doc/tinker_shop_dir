Commands and ways avaible to let others use the tinker shop:
(commands must be typed in the shop)

"allow train"- priv
	set by the guildmaster. People with this may enter the shop
	as many times as they like

"shopallow <player>"- command
	set by any tinker. <player> will be able to enter the tinker 
	shop ONCE. After they have entered, someone must "shopallow" 
	them again for them to enter again.
	
"shopallow all" - command
	set by the guildmaster, wiz, or any tinker with the "allow open"
	priv. This will open or close the store to everyone, depending
	on the state of the store when used.
