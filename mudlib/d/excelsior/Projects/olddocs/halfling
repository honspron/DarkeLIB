Genetic traits:
Halflings are nimble people who can dart here there and everywhere
before you can say any dwarven names.  They are not very strong or
sturdy, but they are of average intelligence and wisdom.
You will be knocked over like a wet noodle by their beauty.

Physical description:
It is hard to describe a halfling.  They have an almost magical aura
about them.  This magical aura helps them not in their magic,  but in
their beauty and charisma.  Though humanoid in appbasic appearence,
they tend to have the most becoming physical traits of all races.
This makes them attractive to everyone.  But don't let them get to
close,  or their liable to snatch up and run away with everything
you own faster then a hog on fire.  (We love making up sayings.)
