Dev:
You can dev once per level, after that you must spend fast dev cost
until next level, but you can fast dev as much as you want.
You get dev points equal to dev point base (1st level) times the level
you advance to and also as a bonus for getting a lot of exp at one time
(eg killing a bad ass monster)

spells:
each spell has a power level (1-6).  Chars know the spell at a certain
level and may only cast it that hi.  spells dev like skills except dev cost
is cumulative, i.e., 2nd level dev = 2* 1st level dev, etc.

Also everyt spell has a certain skill which is required to cast it.

skills:
0-60 by 5's
62-80 by 2's
80 on up by 1's
this is how skills develop.  All skills have an associated stat which 
modifies the skill, so 80 base may be up to 90 to 95 in actuality but
only if you have the stats of satan.  Usual mod for an avg stat is about
6-7 and up to 11-12.

combat SUPER COMPLEX:
 - criticals and shit (but be vague when explaining to players)
 - you can dodge, parry if you have a weapon, and block if you have a shield
 - you can also parry bare-handed but its hard
 - attack skill is cool for any fighting
 - melee is for bare hands
 - dual attack is for multiple weapons
 - also skills specific to weapon type (blunt, blade, two handed blade, etc)
 - penalty for using weapon in off hand unless race is ambidextrous
 - strength is a good thing
 - what is your off hand?  It told you what hand you favor in char creation
in big bold type -- I hope you read it
 - 
thats all folks
