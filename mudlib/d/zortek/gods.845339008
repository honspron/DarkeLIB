First let me start by saying that in NO WAY should it be implied or
understood that Christianity, Islam, Budhism, or any other REAL
world faith is to enter into the context of this game.  It has come
to my attention that progress has been made in the establishment
of a 'God' for the War-Priests and that such is underway for the
Paladins.  As such, much confusion exists as to what powers or
Divinities exist (yes I know this was written plural).  So....

  K'thach -- God of Balance and War (Patron of the War-Priests)
  Chardros -- God of Oblivion and Destruction
  Drulina -- Goddess of Creation and Health
  Padima -- Goddess of Deception and Trickery
  Xig'Fen -- God of the Elements
