%^GREEN%^ OK THIS IS IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT CLANS %^RESET%^


Type help teach in your clan teaching room, note the capacity command in the room.

Also note, the room's level effects how much you can learn total as does the level of the spell/skill that you are training.  Please give me feedback. ALso note, those who have crosstrained some already might notice their capacity lower, but it shouldn't be too low to train even more.
