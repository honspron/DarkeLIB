Casting:

Thank you to all the people who didn't think to inform me that you could cast spells at *0, like this isn't bug abuse? Anyway, i fixed this problem, it is now impossible.  If you still can cast at *0 for some reason please let me know.

Thanks
Thrace

P.S I'm working on tracking down spell and skill bugs, if you find any or have any ideas for new spells or skills let me know my mudmail or tell.
