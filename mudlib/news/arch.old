NOTE!!!!!!
I have fixed the elementalist spell body of eements,
which was permanently jacking up elementalists' melee to
insane levels.
I have instructed elementalists to ask arches to have their
melee repaired.  Do it like this:

call whoever;set_property;"meelee damage";([ "type 1" : val, etc.... ])

To see what the melee should be set to, go to /daemon/db/racial_props
