Well, fyi...
I had to rid Thalos last nite for being an idiot. He didn't realize i was 'snooping' him and i watched him give his GM items to Clanat then within minutes he tried to tell me that they hadn't loaded back on him from login. When i confronted him with his actions and asked him if he was sure whether or not he had really lost them, he just said 'bah' and 'whatever', and so without further adue, i ridded the bastard. (don't you just hate fuckheads that lie and then don't own up to it like a cowardly pussy afterwards?)
