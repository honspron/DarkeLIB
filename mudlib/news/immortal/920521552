Update Command:



It has come to my attention that the update command seems to be bugged when the room does not reload.  I will eventually fix this, but until then DO NOT UPDATE ROOMS WHILE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THEM, it crashes the mud and damages pfiles, etc... we could have a huge problem if these crashes persist.  If you need to update a file, find it's directory, make sure noone is there and then update it like that.  I will post an update when i fix the command.
