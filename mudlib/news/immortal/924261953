I was considering doing the same thing, after i stripped Vinyax of GM for being a total jackass and abuse of a bug, he also was carrying an Amulet of Skaros, one I had reimbed to Thalos a few days ago, strange isn't it?  I was in fact just waiting for an explanation from Thalos before taking action, but since he has done it again and in front of an arch, i guess he got what he deserved.
