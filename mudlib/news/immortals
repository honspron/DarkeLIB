I've been kinda crappy feeling last couple days, on top of working
a lot, and basically my motivation just hasn't been correct. I do,
however, promise to put forth at least one or two documents about what
I'm trying to accomplish with the guilds in a document, alongside
hopefully a set of guidelines for upgrading/adding to current guilds.
Sorry for those who have been excited and expectantly waiting - I'll
get my act together soon :)

This is important.  THe brittle code can be used for more than
tinkered weapons.  For the awesome weapons like the Jeweled Dagger!
Please add set_property("brittle", <amt>);
So there will be a chance of breaking them.
t 29 it will automatically have a chance of breaking.
To give you an idea pussiance is 1 brittle pt per pt of pus.
Ummm runes are 3 points each. etc...
True weapon is like 9.
So please set those super weapons with a nice bittleness to take
in account for how bad ass they are.  We do not want anymore
super weapons.  BTW I miss my super weapon :(

To any wizards who have lost channels:
This is because your guild somehow got set to something funky.
Just do a call <name>;set_class;"child" and quit and come
back and your channels should be ok.

The Basic and Intermediate LPC tutorials are now available in
/doc//lpc
So if in the future I tell you to RTFM it means to Read The Fine Manual.
Because if you ask me and the answer is there, youve wasted my and your time.
These are good tutorials. I recommend everyone look over em.
I also expect all code in the future to adhere to the formatting guidelines
contained therein, with the exception that I wont require you
to //* all functions.  But I do require that you type all functions
and variables.  Its neat and it makes debuggin a lot easier.

The Basic and Intermediate LPC Tutorials can also be accessed from
the Darkemud Wizards WWW page if you want to read them in HTML
format.  (ie so you can look through them in a hypertext manner)

New Creator Commande: change <filename> <reason>
 
This command is used to document when you change ANY file that is not
in your home directory.  (or even if it is in your home directory if
changing it has a mudwide effect.)  THIS IS MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS.
It will be incorporated into ed shortly.
 
As a reminder, if you are making a change to an important file (ie in /std)
please please please make a copy of the working file first in the same
directory as the one you are changing in case you crash the mud with
your change.

Added change list command.  Mores the contents of the /log/change file.

IMPORTANT:

Unless you are a mentor or higher, do NOT for ANY reason affect the natural
course of the MUD in any way.  This includes reimbursements (which we're 
not doing anyhow, basically), 'jacking around', or anything else that affects
players, monsters, objects, etc, etc, etc, et al.

I won't waste my time sayin that you'll be warned once, etc, etc.  This kinda
stuff is for the most part self-evident, and I shouldn't have to be posting
this.  Ie. you can be banished instantly and permanently for the above, 
depending upon your local arches sense of humor at the time, so don't push
luck - Just say NO!

Mentors/Above

In the event that you find it necessary to discipline a player, or otherwise
alter the course of the game in a way that may raise further questions (as
ridding or otherwise maiming people usually does) please follow the same 
relative procedure as when changing code, and mail the arches.  Depending
upon need, a 'punishment' command (similar to change) may be instated.

Same basic principle as 'change' - you are doing something that will cause
alterations in the game, and other arches should at least have half a clue
so they don't have a just-pumped-the-neighbors-cat look on their face when
someone asks them wtf :)

MANDATORY - All wiz's must read help wizlevels and begin to 
operate accordingly.  This means that all Wizard level coders
must petition a Mentor for acceptance. All Mentors should
get together and discuss who will accept who.  If you have
ANY questions about these levels and definitions, please please
ask sp we don't have another person saying "I didnt know."
 
Also if you have not, you must also read help policy and
help newwiz.  This series, and the documents referenced in them
shoudl make everything clear, and should help new wizards
get a good start on life.

Some reminders:
All Wizard level coders must have mentors by Monday.
Wizard levels coders are not allowed to put any code online where it
   can influence a mortal without it first going through their mentor
   and then Khojem for balance.
ALL IMMORTALS must have a .plan and all < Arch must have a .project
Wizard level coders are alllowed a test character <name+i> but those
   characters should never come into contact with mortals.

Updates eval so the there are 5 variables a-e that are predefined as mixed.
If you know what this means, your welcome, if you dont, get heavy :)

For those of you who are using change command, thanks.  For those
of you who arent, start, lest I Lower you wiz level.  If you edit
a file outside of your home dir, then use change, takes 10 seconds.
