I have begun making much in the way of modifications to the "help" files etc., to make them pertain to Darke Domain. If you run across any doc etc that does not pertain, let me know and i'll make copies of it and modify it accordingly.

I have also started a file under /log called Admin_Changes.log

I propose that for the time being, unless anyone has an automatic way of logging keystrokes etc., we post all changes to this file so that we all know who is doing what and making what modifications.

If you correct stuff even as trivial as a typo that was causing errors in the debug.log file however, please note it. We have a hard enough time learning this stuff without thinking it magically disappeard or fixed itself.

If anyone has any other ideas that should be added/removed or discussed in relation to this topic please let me know.. I am wayyyyy open to suggestions on how to clean the place up.
