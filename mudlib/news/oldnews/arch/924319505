Combat and Stun:

It appears there is a slight bug in combat causing certain crits to give a situation where the person in combat is permanently stunned, i'm looking into the problem but I'm not exactly sure why this is happening when it wasn't before.  I'm not sure what to do about it, all I know is that players seem to be dieing from being stunned for way longer than they should.
