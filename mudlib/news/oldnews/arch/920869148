Important info for you guys:
There is quite a few files that still have the DOS CR/LF or ^M at the ends of lines, so if you get an error that was unexpected for something that should be working... trace back through all the files associated with it and use the command strip on them.  ie strip dirs.h 

I think you might have to do that to all the player files.
