Guys, you want to keep the current players around, you must let them know before you got deleting their spells.  I think out of courtesy you all could at least post on their guild board what has changed when you change it, for both player reference and for admin reference.  I don't know who is changing guild balance, and if it's happening without everyone's knowledge then it's going to get changed back.  There has to be good reason to change balance, and if there is good reason, you could at least post it.... maybe i'm being cranky, but i just got bitched at by a couple players and i don't really need that.
