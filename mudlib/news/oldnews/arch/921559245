Don't know whose cute idea it was to add infernal crits to the nightblade guild, but #1 the crit table is not mudlib ready, #2 infernal is totally not in character for NB, i'm changing the spell to some time of stun autocrit

Don't add crit types to the running game unless the crit table is error free and ready. Also, think if it fits the guild for story line... why would nightblades be summoning imps? just doesn't make sense =)
