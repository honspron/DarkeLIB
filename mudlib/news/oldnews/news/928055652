Save on Body:

We made a fairly major change to how the save on body system worked, thanks to Parnell you shouldn't have lost anything and you shouldn't even notice, if you are missing stuff when you restore please let me know ASAP by mail or tells, this will ensure that i find the bug, and i might be able to get your stuff back.
