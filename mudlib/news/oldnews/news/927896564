Off in the distance you hear the roaring laughter of a god.... unsure of what to make of it you continue on about your business.  Moments later you hear a small voice inside your head which says.....
"It has been some time now since we have entered this world together... The gods have seen your worth and have decided to make this world a better place."
Suddenly without notice, a courier arrives from seemingly out of nowhere and tells you...
"Traer has smiled upon us.  He hath decided to expand our link to this world which in turn allows you and I a much less hindered path.  I'm not quite sure of the circumstances mind you, I'm merely a messenger you know, but I have been told of great machines with even more power than before as well as stronger and more open links to this world.  I have but one message which was whispered to me in a dream which said.... "With them the gods were pleased and so decided that this world was good and that it's people should be rewarded with this gift.  Go now and tell the masses for the time hath come when all should realize the benefit of the gods' great gifts."
Then, as quickly as he came, the young courier disappears as if into thin air leaving only a cloud of dust whirling before you.....

Have fun and thanks for hanging in there for the last couple of days through the server and wan upgrade.  The link has been doubled and the server has been increased with greater speed and drive space.  With that, i'm finally gonna get some sleep one of these days now that the major overhaul is complete.  Thanks again and have lots of fun!!!!
