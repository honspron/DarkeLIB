To all the Darkedomainers out there:

You will not see me for a week, because it is March Break and I'm heading down to Florida.  Since I don't have net access or a working computer there I will not be able to come on and help out while I'm gone.  I am leaveing tommorow Saturday March 13th and will be back on Sunday March 21, while I'm gone, my projects are on hold unless someone takes them over.  Also, you will have to find another arch to get reimbs, etc... from.

Anyways, have fun while I'm gone and try not to crash this place too often, Traer has lost enough hair already :)
