A new town has been located 11w 14s of the great Akkad. The town is in ruins because of an attack put rat-man. To find out more enter the town and read the sign.

This place so far is for lvl's 1-6. But more things are being discovered from time to time.

Have fun!! and please report and bugs to me.
