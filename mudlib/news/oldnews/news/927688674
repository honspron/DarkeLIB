Long Term Experience:

In an attempt to balance it out a bit i have changed the equation for long term skills and spells to be solely skill and level based.  This means that players of lower levels may receive less, but it will balance out as you get to higher skill levels and higher levels.  Hopefully this will lower the problem of one long term tick getting newbies FOF and high level folks getting nothing.

P.S. Send me any questions or comments, this formula is still under discussion.
P.P.S. I would like to thank everyone who helped me with this, specifically Marthene, Fireknife, Elendil, Azura and any I missed
