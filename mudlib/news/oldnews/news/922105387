We would like everyone to know Dreen/Randymac (Grast's father) will be undergoing surgery for his back today at 8:00am Central time. The admin, especially myself, would like you all to wish him the best and a speedy recovery. 
Best wishes to Dreen and family, and we hope to see him back very soon!

Thank you all for your support.
