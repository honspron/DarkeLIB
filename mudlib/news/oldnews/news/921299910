New Reimb Policy:

Reimbs are now done only by mail, to save time as well as having you all go to one place and stand there while your stuff is reimbed.  If you need stuff reimbed, mail me. with the exact things lost, tinking skills if possible and spell levels. Your request will be done asap and your stuff returned.
