Don't ask me what the crap is in the top 2 lines... but here goes.
this weekend will be the last of the reincs and reimbs.
i have not had any time to do any code in the last few days due to all the players needind things.
code has not been fixed and bugs are still out there.
as soon a i reimb something, because the bugs are still there you're gonna lose it anyway.
it's a catch 22 all the way around.
as of this moment, i am stating this weekend will be the end of all that
powerlevel now and get your full reinc in this weekend or it won't happen.
don't ask for reimbs, if i have a chance, and you are in desparate need, i will make you a bone sword and some armour and you can have a chanter or tinker or whoever help you with spells runes etc.
if we don't get the bugs out, it won't be worth playing.
let us get this done and we'll all have a better time.
thanks for your understanding and have FUN!!!
