If you have impreg/impreg armour, armour with very high protection, you have two days to either

get it replaced by an arch or trash it.

Some how forge armour got a little bit buffed... or a lot bit...

Just do the right thing and get it updated with me or another arch.


or i'll be forced to hassle you constantly like i do hellbringer.
