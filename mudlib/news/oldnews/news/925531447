Pets:

Yes, i know that pets don't save well and that they often come back and you don't own them anymore, but any save room that has more than 15 pets in it is almost guaranteed to bug out, this is a warning to everyone who keeps pets in save rooms, if you have more than 15 in there you will lose some if not all over a reboot.
