Ok, now that we are on Unix and we will prolly be staying it means we can get doen to business.  This means that wizzes and admins will be working on ironing out the bugs that are present in the various crit tables etc... Also this means that we need wizzes to create areas that will set us apart from the other darkemuds around.  If you are interested in wizzing here please tell me and we will talk about you ideas.  In order to wiz you don't have to have very much experience, that is what mentors are for, just good ideas and a willingness to work. You also can keep your current PC as we will be setting up a test site for wiz level immortals to work on.
