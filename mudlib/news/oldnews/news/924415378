Bad news for some of you and your saved items... 
if you had items that showed up in your inventory as iron-bracer, iron-greaves or really iron-anything that is not really iron but is the "name" of the type of armour, odds are it has bugged your save file.  all this means is that everything in your inventory that would load after that item will probably not load... it sux but due to a change made in the armour types data file a bug was found to screw up the loading.  sorry for the inconvenience, hopefully this won't happen once you have fixed your inventory.
if you have such items on you now i suggest you get rid of them before you save and logoff.. odd are you won't get your stuff back if you dont.
