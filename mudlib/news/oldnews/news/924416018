This just in.....
In an effort to make death a "little more real", we have instituted a new change to PKs.
The way it works is simple.....
Based on the victims' level they have a certain % chance of losing 1 point to a random stat when they are killed by any player.
There is also a modifier due to the attacker's level that can raise or lower this chance based on the difference between the two levels.. for example...
A low level player, let's say level 5, has a small chance of losing 1 point to a random stat when they are pk'd by any player... let's say the attacker is a level 15, the modifier will then lower that chance even more due to the major difference in levels..
Now if a level 15 player is killed by a level 5 player, the chance that the level 15 player loses a stat will be greater because of the negative difference in levels.  Thus, high-mortals will not be multi-killing lower level players to 0 stats because the chance a lower level player has at losing that stat will be very small... however, if a low level mortal were to multi kill a high-mortal, the chance that the high-mortal would lose several points, (1 for each death) is great.
