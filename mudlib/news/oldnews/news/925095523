Bots:

Let me direct your attention to 'help rules' people, i know we have been fairly lax about this thus far, but why bother mudding if all you are going to do is bot?  The rules are clear botting is cheating and will be dealt with in such a manner.  There is no reason why you should be botting so don't do it, at all, ever.
