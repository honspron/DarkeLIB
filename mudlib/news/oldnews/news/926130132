Change to party system.

Hopefully if I did this right, in order to get party bonuses, you must be in party, and same room.  Also to get the exp, you need to be involved in the act that gets the exp.  This means long terms should only give exp to the long termer, NOT to the party.  And that combat should share exp only to those involved in the combat.
