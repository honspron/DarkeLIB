Guilds and Guild Councils:

I have been doing a lot of thinking on the subject of guild masters and guild councils.  I am looking for a new system for this that is unlike the other Darkes.  My big suggestion is to have guild leadership by comittee rather than one single person.  This would mean a transfer of power from the guildmasters to the guild councillors.

I am looking for suggestions on the subject, please mail me with your thoughts, this system is likely some time off, but all imput will be appreciated.
