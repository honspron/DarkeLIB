We will be going to a static IP tonite and are looking at registering a domain name sometime within the next couple of days.  thanks for putting up with this small transition but if you knew how much shit we had to go thru to get the server up and dedicated for this mud, you would all understand i'm sure.  nothing like settin up a server and putting it online in less than 24hrs.  Mactorg would understand methinks!!  :)  Have Fun!
