Save on Body:

It has come to my attention this morning that the save on body code seems to be ignoring work done on items, so if you start a long-term and save the item in this way it appears you will have to start again.  This doesn't seem to be the case with lockers, so I would suggest that you keep items like that in lockers until I get a chance to track down the error.
