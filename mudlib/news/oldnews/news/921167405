Ok, I can now restore lockers that lose stuff that was in them, please tell me as soon as you realize that something is missing and i can probably get it back.  The only catch is, you can't close any of the lockers in your room or put any new lockers in it until the locker is restored, if you do that the locker files are deleted and can't be restored by me.  DO NOT CLOSE LOCKERS IF YOU WANT EM TO BE RECOVERED!.
