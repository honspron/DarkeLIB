Ok, enough with worrying about the pwipe already!  If we do a pwipe it's prolly still a hell of a long way from now anyway. It's not something that is gonna happen in the next couple of weeks or so at the given rate. Expect to be playing your current char for awhile unless you ask for a rid. Then you can start over if you like. We don't know for sure how/when we will get to beta and whether or not that would be a pwipe then, so again , QUIT WORRYING YOURSELF ABOUT IT! Jeesh!

If anyone has any questions as to what the hell it is I'm talking about then, ask someone else on chat or newbie.  :)

Lastly... 
Full/Half/Quarter or otherwise Free Reincs and Reimbursements *(other than GM weapons) of any kind are now HISTORY!  Do not mail me or any other Arch about them please. If you would like to have your character rid'ed, just ask any available Arch on and we will gladly do that for you. We may put the old suicide command back in at TS if it proves to be a daily chore for us though. Just keep in mind that if you are rid'ed you will be starting your character from scratch. Remember those 3k devs you got when you started? Well, I feel as though some have gotten it and others haven't so now nobody does. You don't start here at automatic level 5 either! Go play the mud! Have fun for goodness sakes!

If you can't understand any of the above, ask Lollabrigida to explain it to ya! I'm sure she'd be happy to assist you by hunting your character to 0xp along with the help of everyone else that gets it by now!

To those of you that have hung in here... Many thanks and we'll try to get coding instead of bs'ing all day now.  Woohoo!
