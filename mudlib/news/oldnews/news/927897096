Since the server has been upgraded to a newer version of Linux the web page is currently down (as if most of you even give a rip) :( but will be back up soon.  If anyone is interested in it let me know otherwise i'll take my time trying to get it running.  Let me just say this.. since we own the server, putting up a web space for the mud is easier and faster than having it on some Isp's site and allows us unlimited space.  I was thinking of making the page somewhere where you all can have more fun with guild pages, flame pages, offerings, clan pages etc., you can send the content, you can structure it however you like i just figure it's another way for us to have a good time.  if no one is interested then i'll leave the idea to die, otherwise let me know and i'll put it back up and we can have some fun.  Incidently, the webpages address is the same as the mud, http://207.227.182.222 and you'll go there once it's back up.
