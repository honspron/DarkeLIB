Breast Plates:

I found a fairly large bug in the virtual table for breast plates.  It set the base ac of plates to 1 instead of 55.  This will make a very big difference in the protection that breast plates give.  If you have had a breast plate made recently, you might want to speak to a tinker about getting a new one with the proper protection values.

Sorry for the Inconvenience, but it's better you know now.
