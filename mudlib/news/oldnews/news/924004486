Clans:

I realize that some of you may have known about this bug and neglected to tell anyone, but clan train halls are bugged so that those who are not in the clan can train, this should not be the case.  Doing so is cheating and will be dealt with in the appropriate manner.  Those who have done it before this message please speak to an arch to have the skills removed immediately
