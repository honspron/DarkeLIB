GM Items:

If you are not a GM and you have GM items you are ridded no questions asked, no way to get outta it.  If you are a GM and you loan you equipment out same thing goes, this stuff should not be give to others ever.  Starting now if I see you with GM stuff that isn't yours you are gone.  I'm tired of people giving away their stuff and asking for mure, not only is it stupid but it's cheating.  This is the final warning, trash it if you have it.
