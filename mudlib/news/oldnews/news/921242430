Darkechat:

I would like to say a huge thank you to Helios and anyone else who helped set up the darkechat line and the other parts of the intermud system. 

As with the other muds on this system, Dark Prophecy, DarkeMUD and Land of the Chosen, I would like to echo that abuse of this line is not appropriate nor will it be tolerated.  As  the admins have said on the other muds, first offence is warning, second is rid.

Otherwise, have fun and talk to your fellow mudders
