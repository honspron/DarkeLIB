Extra! Extra! 
A town crier has been added to the city of Akkad. He will be enlisted by the gods to keep you informed should any newsworthy events unfold.
Rumor has it that a band of dwarves have been hired to start a newspaper and will be stocking the town crier up as fast as their scribes can get it on paper.
Currently, the town crier has limited access to information but is on the lookout for scouts throughout the realm. He will be hiring eager young reporters and they in turn will get as much information regarding events back to the dwarven scribes.
Should any newsworthy events happen, you may seek him out near Slim's general store in the sw corner of Akkad.
