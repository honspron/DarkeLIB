Clean Command:



This wasn't supposed to be a mortal command, i don't have any idea how it got there, just don't type clean until next reboot and it will be fine.  If you do it will delete your inventory, I will not reimb from this, so don't do it.



The church has been fixed, the new command to remove poison is 'cleanse poison'.
