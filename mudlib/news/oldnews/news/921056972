Be warned TS is no longer a safe haven, just the church, Unless another arch tells me differently i'm going through and taking out all safe spots but the church (for the newly revived).


ALSO NOTE
SPELL CHANGE, you can no longer move cast into safe rooms, if you find a way that you can, please notify me.

Spells no longer give instant cast bonuses, due to extreme ability to abuse by chaotic-lords and others somewhat.
