Save on Body:

Thanks in larg part to Helios, I have put together a save on body code.  This means that everything you are carrying with the exception of stuff in bags will be saved on your person from now on when you quit.  If you restore objects that are either invisible or have the name 0, please let me know.

Thanks
Thrace Merin
