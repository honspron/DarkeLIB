Mines and Ingots:



It appears much to my dismay that mines do not work, I will look at them, but it is a big job and i might not get around to it for a while.  This means that mines are a waste of money, so don't buy em.



I have added an ingot seller in akkad, he sells various types of ingots, but I will warn you he is not cheap be prepared to be ripped off.  He is 4e1n1e of TS in akkad, he will remain open until i fix mines.



Thanx for your understanding,

Thrace
