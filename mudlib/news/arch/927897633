Could someone please look into the binaries directory for me please and tell me what should be in that dir.  It would seem that for some unknown reason to me that alot of dirs have been added to that directory with binary copies of files. I believe it was due to an ftp i may have done some time ago but i'm unsure about what can be removed and what can't. If anyone knows what should be there and what doesn't need to be it would sure make for an easier backup removing so many duplicates of files that don't need to be there.  
Thanks for your help guys, it's really appreciated!
