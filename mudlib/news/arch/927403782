I gave dresj half his old levels, he was victim of a ridding back when we had some unsavory people behind the admin wheel.  If there is a problem with players and my decision, i would appreciate if people didn't speak about it on chat and such and bring it to me for discussion before going all out to the players about stuff. I went off of his word as he is a trusted friend.
