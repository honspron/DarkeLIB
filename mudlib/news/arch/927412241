Ok, it has come to my attentio....  some very disturbing news...
I've have been notified that there are times when I am not on yet someone is logged on with my name.  Now since I do not use a standard password i'm assuming someone did not just guess it and log on as me but that someone must be su'ing as me which would make it only avail to an arch.  this has been picked up on by someone close and personal to me and he knows when i'm on and when im not so there is not any mistakes in this.  if i find out who is becoming me when i'm not here i will immediately remove your access for good.  there is no reason where someone should be shadowed as me, su'ed as me etc... you have your access for a reason and do not need to be logged in as me.. i have no additional rights
If you or someone you know has done thi... fess up or let me know...
