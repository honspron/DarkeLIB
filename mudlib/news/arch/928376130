ok i added something to the teach func file of the clan crosstraining system, now there is a limit to how much total xtraining someone can have.  Basically depending on the room there is a max number 500,700,or 1000 and each time they train a skill one notch it adds that skill level in points to their total and for spells it's the * x the spell level.

Also, i added the functionality to make skills/spells non crosstrainable, just ed the skill/spell and in the create function stick set_property("no crosstrain", 1); in there and they won't be able to xtrain it (for u  balance people)
