Mikus asked Duridian and myself to relieve some of the administrative
load from Mikus and Drizzt by assuming the role of area approval.  We
decided to expand this by including a quality control slice to the 
entire thing.  We hope that you will support us in this role and provide
input and communication to make our task easier and more effective.

I have installed a QC board near the LPC, project, and damned board
locations.  I'd like you to use this as a place to openly discuss issues
concerning area balance and overall mud balance.  

For your reading enjoyment I created a sub-directory under /open titled
"QC".  Included are outlines and examples of items required for area
submission.  Also, are several files that examine armours/weapons.
We plan expanding this in the future, so check back occasionally.

*********************************************************************
As a subnote to this, I've almost finished talking to all of you
wizards about your projects.  I've put down everyone's projects
into /open/wiz_projects.  Everyone should go check it out at the
very least to see the impressive number of things that are coming
up.  They should also try to estimate the times of completion
for their projects and add it to the file.  If you are really 
close to finishing your area and need to have it approved,
mail either me, Khojem, or Duridian.  We will schedule a time
to approve your area.

Thanks you for your cooperation.  The mud should rock after we
get these projects done!

************************************************************
ALL WIZARDS please write down there test and player characters
in a file /open/wiz_characters
If you do not and I catch you.. You will be deleted!
Just follow the format.  I will write mine down.
SOMEHOW the old one was erased???
BTW, it is illegal to have a wiz and player on at the same time!
Also please read /open/admin

I am starting to hear players bitching about wiz's screwing around
with players.  Do not interfer with the players.  Don't fuck
around or anything.  Also I have heard a few of you are abusing
your status as a wizard with your players.  If this does not
stop NO WIZARD will be able to have player characters period!
If I catch you cheating or fucking with a player I am going to
delete you.  Do not give players any information!  Your job is
to code that is it.  DO NOT INTERACT WITH THE PLAYERS PERIOD!
It is a privilage to be able to play and code.  Don't fuck it up!

That is all :)~  Ohh yea.. Most of you all seem
to be doing a rocking job on the areas.  Keep the good work
up!

This has been stated before, I know, but a couple whispers I heard inspire
me to state it yet a second time: DO NOT ask players to test things for 
you. It's just wrong. We allow almost everyone a test character for this
on here, and while it's a wonderful temptation to ask players to look at
things, etc, it creates both considerable risk to the stability of the MUD.
Just don't, I don't want to have to play with the rid command, it's 
annoying.
