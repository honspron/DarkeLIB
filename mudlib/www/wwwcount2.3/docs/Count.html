<ul type=square>
<li> Uses image strip as well as individual digit images. Using an image
strip reduces disk i/o significantly, therefore, it's faster. A program will
be supplied to create an image strip from individual digit images. 
<p>
<li> Comma can be displayed after every 3rd digit from right.
<p>
<li> Any one color of the image can be changed on the fly.
<p>
<li> Uses netmasks o mask out a range of hosts in the network or the entire
network.
<p>
<li> Automatic datafile creation, strict mode, use of rgb color database
can be controlled from the cfg file at run time. 
<p>
<li> Any arbitrary GIF file can be displayed. Frame and other attributes of
the counter can be applied to the GIF file.
<p>
<li> If you are looking for a dynamic clock, you can check out my

<h2>1. Requirements</h2>
</A>
<ul>
<LI> <B>Unix, NT or OS/2 </B> Operating System.
<P>
The previous  version (2.2) is ported OS/2. 
The current version (2.3) works on unix, NT (intel) and Win95. The version
2.2 is ported to Mac by someone. It will be available If I can obtain the
distribution from the person.
<p>
<LI> A C compiler (ANSI or non-ANSI).
<P>
<LI> You should be familiar with Unix operating system in order to install
it on Unix. I think if you know what <b>ls</b> command is, you qualify. If your
site is configured to run CGI program from users' space, then you will not need root access.
<P>
<LI> You must run a <I>httpd</I> daemon (tested with NCSA,CERN and APACHE
httpd). It also works with Netscape Communications Server (reported by
Scott Barnhill <I>(cosbarnh@ihc.com)</I>.
However it should work with any http server which supports CGI
programs.  I personally run 
<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/info.html">APACHE</A> httpd 1.0.5. I think
it's the best freely available http server for Unix. If you run several 
http servers in your domain, you can install the counter in one server and
allow the users at other servers to access the counter remotely.
</ul>
<P>
<blockquote>
I personally compiled and tested it on a Sparc 10 (SunOS 4.1.4) running
NCSA httpd 1.4 , CERN httpd 3.0, APACHE httpd 1.0.5, (gcc 2.6.3).
<p>
It is reported that the counter runs on:
<pre>
    [Linux]           | [Solaris 2.x] | [BSDI]       | [SGI IRIX 5.3] 
    [AIX 3.2.5]       | [HP-UX-?]     | [Ultrix 4.3] | [SCO]
    [AT&T Unix SVR4]  | [DEC Alpha 3000/300L with OSF/1]
    [MS NT]           | [MS Win95]

<h2>2. Introduction</h2>
</A>
<blockquote>
This is a 
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi">CGI</A>
program to keep record of the raw hits of a web page. It
generates a GIF image of the number of hits and returns to the browser as
an in-lined image.  The program also has a run-time option not to show the digit
images, this way the hits can be kept without displaying it. The hits can be
be monitored without incrementing from a separate page as well.
Almost all of the
<A HREF="#feat">features</A> are run-time options.
The hits are no way accurate. Someone can reload the page again and again to
increase the hits. However, people like to see how many times someone visited
their page. The same program can be used to count hits for any number of web
pages for any number of users. The program can be used to display time or date
as well. The time or date of any place in the word can be displayed by
specifying a <b>timezone</b> string for that location. The date can be
formatted in any combination of <b>MMDDYY</b> (Month-Day-Year).
This program started as a fun to play
with CGI programming but due to enormous interest, feature request, input
from thousands of you, it has
turned in to the most configurable counter on the whole <b>World Wide
Web</b> and <b>it is free and always will be free</b>.
<P>
The program is distributed as a gzip'd tar archive. If you do not have
gzip/gunzip, it's available at:
<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">prep.ai.mit.edu</a>.

</font>
<P>
<LI> Count 2.0 is backward compatible with Count1.5's URL. One thing to
note, the keyword <b>wxh</b> has no meaning in Count 2.0. It was used in
Count 1.5 to specify digit dimensions. In Count 2.0 it is not required,
because the digit dimensions are determined automatically. Therefore, you
can use variable width digit images in this version.
<P>
<li> Reasonable default for all <b>QUERY_STRING</b> parameters.
<p>
<li> The same program can be used to display time or date.
<p>
<li> The time and date of any timezone in the world can be displayed. The
time can be displayed in 12 or in 24 hour format.
<p>
<li> Supports digit images with variable width.
<p>
<li> Counter can be displayed without incrementing (for monitoring etc.)
<p>
<li> A literal digit string can be displayed.
<p>
<li> A random digit string can be displayed.
<p>
<li> The color of the digits can be negated.
<p>
<li> The counter can be rotated (only integral of 90 degrees, 90,180,270).
The default rotation is 270 degrees.
<p>
<LI> An <B>ornamental 3D frame</B> can be wrapped around the counter image
with user defined thickness and color at <I>run time</I>.
<p>
<li> The frame and transparent color can be a name (e.g. red,green,pink
etc.). The color can be specified as a hex string, e.g. ffffff, ff0000 etc.
as well as RGB triplets as before.
<P>
<LI> Single program for any number of users for any number of web pages. 
<P>
<LI> Any color of the counter image can be made <B>transparent</B> at
<I>run time</I>.
<P>
<LI> Style of digits can be specified at <I>run time</I>.
<P>
<LI> Authorized host names can be in the configuration file. To handle
<A HREF="http://www.netaxs.com/people/pudge/"><B>"Counter Terrorism"</B></a>,
(looks like this page is dead!) the source code modification is not necessary.
<P>
<LI> IP filtering through a configuration file at <I>run time</I>. Any number of
hosts can be ignored from counting. A netmask can be used to filter out a
specific range of host in a network or to filter out the entire network.
It's a good idea to ignore your own host or entire domain. Gen-conf program
will let you create the configuration file interactively.
<P>
<LI><b>Advisory data file locking</b>. Data file will not get messed up by
simultaneous Count.cgi processes. Advisory data file locking is superior to
ancillary file locking because advisory locking is handled directly by the
Operating System. 
<P>
<LI> Maximum number of digits can be set or counter can be displayed with
exact number of digits at <I>run time</I>.
<P>
<LI> User will be able to specify a start-up counter value at <I>run
time</I>. This will take effect if the data file does not exist. You will
be prompted by the configuration program if you want this feature or not.
<P>
<LI> If you <b>do not want to display the counter</b> but like to keep the
hits on your page, sh=0 can be defined in the QUERY_STRING at <I>run time</I>.
It will write a 1x1 transparent GIF image to the browser but the counter in the
data file will be incremented all right.

<h2>6. Directory Structure (unix)</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
Before going to the configuration procedure, please browse through
the default directory structure below. It will help you answering questions
of the configuration script. You can change the name of the directories
as you please, but keep the directory structure same, it will make your
life much easier. You do not have to create any of these directories, they
will be created for you by the Count-install program. Only thing you 
probably have to create are the individual datafiles (keep reading).
<p>
<img src="images/countdst.gif" alt=[image]>
<p>
<b>Base Directory</b> is the directory where all the sub-directories and
the files related to counter reside. 
<p>
<b>Log Directory</b> is the directory which holds the counter Log file.
Counter error messages or if someone tries to access your counter remotely,
warning message regarding this is written to this file.
<p>
<b>conf</b> directory holds the configuration file for the counter. 
configuration file holds information in 4 blocks. Each
block resides between a left and right curly brace. 
This file is created by the program <b>Gen-conf</b> and can be hand crafted
later. After creating the file, please read the comments in the file.
To know more about netmasks which can be used in the 4th block,
please read the section <a href="#hign">How to write "Host Ignore" block in
the configuration file</a> to know how to write the "Host Ignore" block.
<p>
<b>data</b> directory holds all the datafiles for the counter. The datafiles
stores the access counts of web pages. Each page must have a separate
datafile. The datafile is specified at run-time. You will know about it
later.
<p>
<b>digits</b> directory holds sub-directories with various styles of GIF
digits. For example, <b>A</b> sub-directory holds the green led digits.
The sub-directories have GIF digit files named zero.gif, one.gif...nine.gif.
you will know about it later.
<p>
<b>rgb.txt</b> file is used to convert a color name (for example, cyan) to the
appropriate red, green and blue color component. This file came from 
X consortium and supplied with the distribution. You will know about the
file later.

<H2>4. Digit Styles (all platforms)</H2>
</a>
<blockquote>
The digits used in this program can be individual GIF files or all the
digits can be in a single image strip. This gives 
flexibility of using digits of your choice. In case of individual 
digit images, they  are named as
zero.gif, one.gif,.... nine.gif. In case of image strip, the strip is
named as strip.gif. At run-time, simply the directory of the
images is specified to use a different style. 
Therefore, a single program can display digits of various styles.
Here are the supplied digit styles. I will not supply individual digit images
anymore. All the styles of digits are supplied as a single image strip.
Note the order of the digits (you will know about it later).

This program will work with any digits from the Digit Mania page.
To use those digits, create subdirectories say, F,G, H etc. inside the
digits directory and rename the images to zero.gif, one.gif..nine.gif.
I suggest create an image strip out of these digits and use it instead of
using individual images.

<A NAME="steps">
<h2>7. Steps to compile and install (unix)</h2>
</A>
<blockquote>
In the current release of the counter, there should not be any need for
hand editing any files. Several configuration scripts are supplied to automate
the whole process. I am giving a little description about the scripts just
may be you are curious:
<p>
<i>Count-config</i>
<br>
script to generate the header file config.h, a variable
template file for install program.
<p>
<i>configure</i>
<br>
script to generate correct Makefiles for any Unix system.
<p>
<i>Gen-conf</i>
<br>
script to generate the configuration file.
<p>
<i>Count-install</i>
<br>
script to install the Count binary Count.cgi, digit images, configuration
file and the rgb color name database to the correct places.
<p>

Now at the shell prompt (shell prompt is where you type ls, read your mails
etc.), type the following commands in the described order and press Return
key:
<p>
<b>./Count-config</b>
<blockquote>
The script will ask questions with brief description. Answer them.
Look at the directory structure image to better understand the questions.
<br>
<a href="c-c.html"><B>Look at a sample session</B></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>./configure</b>
<blockquote>
The script will not ask any questions, but you will see the informational
messages about your system. It will create the Makefiles (Makefile and
combine/Makefile) for your system.
<br>
<a href="confi.html"><B>Look at a sample session</B></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>make clean</b> (<i>not needed if you compiling the first time</i>)
<br>
<b>make</b>
<blockquote>
Compilation will start if the previous two scripts completed successfully.
It will take some time. If compilation succeeds, go to the next step.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>./Gen-conf</b>
<blockquote>
This script will ask you questions about your system. Answer them.
This process will create the configuration file for the counter. 
<br>
<a href="gen-c.html"><B>Look at a sample session</B></a>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>./Count-install</b>
<blockquote>
This is the final step. This scripts will install the necessary things
for the counter in your system. You will need root access if you are
installing it an area where root access is needed. This program will ask you
couple of questions.
</blockquote>
<p>
If you finished all the above steps successfully, you are ready to test
the counter. Go to the next section.
</blockquote>
<a NAME="stepsn">
<h2>8. Steps to compile and install (NT)</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
You do not need to compile the program for NT in order to use it.
A compiled version is already supplied. I compiled the program on NT 3.51
(intel) with MS Visual C++ 4.0. The makefiles supplied are for MS Visual
C++ 4.0 as well. If you use some other kind of compiler, you are on your
own.
<p>
Assuimg you already downloaded and extracted the sources from the archive.
Open a command shell window and perform the following steps:
<pre>
    1. Edit the file configNT.h and see if you need to change anything.

    2. cd wwwcount2.3
    3. cd combine
    4. nmake -f makefile.wnt
    5. cd ..
    6. nmake -f makefile.wnt
</pre>
The above procedure will create the executable <b>Count.exe</b>. Copy the
file <b>Count.exe</b> to your <b>cgi-bin</b> or <b>scripts</b> directory 
or where ever you keep the CGI programs. Open the File Manager and copy or
move the directory <b>wcount</b> to <b>C</b> drive (if you edited the file
configNT.h and changed the location, copy it there). Read the section
<a href="#refr">How to call the program?</a>.
<p>
If you want to create the program <i>mkstrip.exe</i>, do:
<pre>
    1. cd utils
    2. nmake -f makefile.wnt
    3. Copy or move the file mkstrip.exe to somewhere in your path.
</pre>

</blockquote>
<A NAME="test">
<h2>9. Test the program from command line (unix)</h2>
</A>
<blockquote>
A shell script is supplied for testing the counter. the name of this
script is <I>testcount-sh</I>. Look at this script, you might need to change
certain things.  Please read the comments in this script for understanding the
various run-time options of the counter. You'll also know in detail about
the options in the section
<A HREF="#refr">How to call the program</a>.When you are happy with
everything, save it and at the shell prompt
type:
<PRE>
    ./testcount-sh
</PRE>
</blockquote>
<A NAME="refr">
<h2>10. How to call the program? (all platforms)</h2>
</A>
<blockquote>
You can refer to the program from web page like this:
<P>
<b>
&lt;img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?df=sample.dat" align=absmiddle&gt;
</b>
<P>
The string between ? and " is called the QUERY_STRING. Make sure there is
no newlines in the &lt;img src= line and no space in the QUERY_STRING. 
Here in, <b>df=sample.dat</b>, <b>df</b> means datafile and <b>sample.dat</b>
is the counter datafile. The counter stores the hits in this file. This
datafile is supplied. 
If you configured the counter to allow automatic datafile creation (look at
count.cfg file), you can specify a datafile with <b>df</b> like
<b>df=count.dat</b>. The file count.dat will be created for you if the 
permission to the data directory is correct. 
<p>
If you configured not to allow automatic datafile creation (good thing), 
you have to create this file in the data directory.
cd to the data directory and type:
<pre>
    echo 1 > count.dat
</pre>
<p>
The counter program has lots of options, you can make it work and look the
way you desire. In the query string, you can use the options described
in the table below. The options can be separated by a | or a &. You can
use either one or combination of both. Here is an example:
<b>
<pre>
&lt;img src="/cgi-bin/Count.cgi?ft=T&frgb=gold|df=sample.dat" align=absmiddle&gt;
</pre>
</b>
<p>The options can be in any order and not case sensitive.
<p>
Anyway, look at this
<a href="Count2ex.html"> <B>Example Page</B></a>
you will get the picture.

        The parameter <b>timezone=</b> is only significant with

        if you want to display time or date of another timezone. 
        The timezone must be specified with a negative or positive
        four digit offset from GMT, for example: <b>timezone=GMT-0500</b> or
        <b>timezone=GMT+0000</b> or <b>timezone=GMT+0530</b>.
        The routine to display time of various timezones are written in a
        generic way. Therefore, the unix machines will not be aware of
        daylight saving time because of the way the routine is written. For
        example, if daylight saving time is on, to display time of NY, the
        timezone will be <b>timezone=GMT-0500</b> instead of
        <b>timezone=GMT-0400</b>.  <p>
        If the clock displays your local time wrong, specify 
        your timezone
        with that parameter in order to display the correct time.

            param, the default color is used. 
        <P>
            If you specify a frgb= without a ft=, then the frame
            thickness defaults to 5. All the examples show ft=5. 
            The color can be specified as hex string or a name.
            <b>Do not use a # before the hex string as Netscape.</b>
            For example, if you want to specify white in hex, use

<h2>12. How to use other styles of digits</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
There are several sites including
<A HREF="http://cervantes.learningco.com/kevin/digits/"><I>Digit Mania</I>
</a>
which maintains a array of collection of GIF digits which can be used with
the counter. The counter program can use these digits in 2 ways. 
<ol>
<li> use a individual digit image for each digit, for example, zero.gif,
one.gif...nine.gif. These digit images reside in the 
<a href="#dirs">digits/style</a> directory. If you like to use the counter for
<b>clock</b>, 3 additional digit images are required, e.g., colon.gif,
am.gif and pm.gif. If you want to use <b>comma</b> in your counter digits,
another image is required, e.g., comma.gif. If you want to use the counter
to display <b>date</b>, one more image is required, e.g., dash.gif.  <b>If
you collect digits from external source, do not forget to rename the images
to <i>zero.gif, one.gif, two.gif, ... nine.gif, colon.gif, am.gif, pm.gif,
comma.gif and dash.gif</i></b>
<p>
<li> <b>use a single image strip for digits</b>. This is the default behavior,
that is the counter program looks for a image file called <b>strip.gif</b>
in <a href="#dirs">digits/style</a> directory by default. Using an image
strip is much more efficient than using individual digits, because 
<p>
    <ol>
    <li> the
size of an image strip is almost always less than the combined size of
individual images.
<p>
    <li> Disk i/o is significantly reduced, because only one file needs to
    be opened instead of many.
    </ol>
</ol>
The section <a href="#strip">How to create an image strip</a>
describes how to create an image strip from individual digit images.
If you like to use the individual digits instead, you <b>must</b> use
the option <b>istrip=F</b> when you call the counter from web page, because
by default <b>istrip=T</b>.

<h2>13. How to create an image strip</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
If you have individual digit images, you can create a image strip out of
them. Image strip reduces disk i/o significantly, because the counter will
need to read only one image instead of many and the size of the image will
in most cases will be less than the combined size of the individual images. 
There is a program called <i>mkstrip</i> is supplied with the distribution
for making image strip.
To compile the program, go to the <i>utils</i> directory and at the shell
promt, type:
<pre>
    make
</pre>
Please note, this program requires the GIF image combining library.
Therefore, compile it after compiling the counter.
<p>
If compilation succeeds, it will create the binary <i>mkstrip</i>.
Now, go to the directory where all the individual digit images are and type:
<pre>
mkstrip zero.gif one.gif two.gif .... nine.gif colon.gif am.gif pm.gif &gt; strip.gif
</pre>
Note, the file names are not important but the order is very important. For
example, the file names may be 0x.gif, 1x.gif etc.
<p>
Create a directory say <b>F</b> inside the <b>digits</b> directory and copy
or move the file <i>strip.gif</i> to <b>F</b>. You can use this strip with
<b>dd=F</b>.
<p>
The above strip can be used for counter and clock but not date. It also can
NOT be used if you want to display comma. If you want to use date and comma,
you must have the image for comma and dash. For example, the strip of digit
style A is created with the command:
<pre>
mkstrip zero.gif one.gif ... nine.gif colon.gif am.gif pm.gif comma.gif \
    dash.gif &gt; strip.gif
</pre>
Please note the order of the images used in arguments carefully. 
<font color="brown">The program
<i>mkstrip</i> puts the necessary information in the GIF comment extension
about the strip.  The counter program parses the comment extension to 
determine the width of the individual digits in the strip. Therefore,
the strip can have digit segments of variable width.
</font>
<p>
For example, the comment of the image strip of digit style A is:
<pre>
15:0:15:30:45:60:75:90:105:120:135:150:165:180:195:210:225
</pre>
The leftmost integer 15 indicates there are 15 individual digits in the
image and the next colon separated pairs are the location of 
left and right side of the segment
of the individual images from the leftmost edge. If you look carefully you
will see that the individual segment of the strip is 15 pixel wide. The
height is determined by reading the image. If you use the program
<i>mkstrip</i>, you do not need to know anything about the comment, it will
be created correctly for you.  It is mentioned here because it is possible
you obtained a strip from somewhere and you want to add the comment to the
image.

<h2>14. How to write "Host Ignore" block</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
This section of the document and the code to use netmasks is written by
<b>Davorin Bengez,</b> <a
href="mailto:dbengez@znanost.hr"><i>(dbengez@znanost.hr)</i></a>
<p>
<b>1. Summary of changes</b>
<p>
`Host ignore' block contains one or more lines with IP addresses
of hosts that will be ignored for counter updates.
<p>
New feature in this release is possibility to mask off groups of hosts
(subnetworks) defined by corresponding network / netmask pairs.
This can be useful if we wish to exclude accesses from the hosts on
our campus or hosts of people developing the pages.
<p>
To accomplish this, each line in host ignore block can take two arguments.
If second argument is present, first is assumed to be network address and
second the netmask. If only one argument is present, it is taken as a
host address.
<p>
Wildcarding the IP address using asterisks cannot be used anymore.
<p>
If this concept with "network address / netmask" sound unfamiliar,
you should consult your friendly network administrator.
<p>
<b>2. How to determine ignore hosts parameters</b>
<p>
To configure `ignore hosts' block in configuration file, you should
know at least how network / netmask concept works.
Here is a brief description.
<p>
<b>2.1. IP Addresses and netmasks concept</b>
<p>
IP address is a 32 bit value (four octets) that is for readability
purposes written as four decimal values separated by a dot
(so called dotted quad).
For example, network address - in dotted quad notation
<pre>
 161.53.4.28
</pre>
is - in binary notation
<pre>
 10100001 00110101 00000100 00011100
</pre>
Binary representation is what we will need to determine network
addresses and netmasks.
<p>
Each network IP address is contained of network and host part.
<p>
Generally speaking, networks are split into several classes.
Here are three primary forms [1]:
<p>
- class A network has first octet in range from 0 to 127.
  First octet is network address while other three octets specify
  the host part.
  In binary notation it is something as (n - network, h - host)
<pre>
 0nnnnnnn hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh
</pre>
There are 2<sup>7</sup> such possible networks, each with 
(2<sup>24</sup> - 2) hosts.
<p>
- class B network has first octet in range from 128 to 191.
  First two octets are the network address, and third and fourth
  are host address.
  In binary notation it is something as (n - network, h - host)
<pre>
 10nnnnnn nnnnnnnn hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh
</pre>
  There are 2<sup>14</sup> such possible networks, each with 
(2<sup>16</sup> - 2) hosts.
<p>
- class C network has first octet in range from 192 to 223.
  First three octets are the network address, and fourth is 
  host address.
  In binary notation it is something as (n - network, h - host)
<pre>
 110nnnnn nnnnnnnn nnnnnnnn hhhhhhhh
</pre>
  There are 2<sup>21</sup> such possible networks, each with 
(2<sup>8</sup> - 2) hosts.
<p>
Note: "-2" is because 0 is reserved for "this host", and 255 means
broadcast, or "all hosts on this network".
<p>
Nothing stops us to divide the network given to us by a service
provider into a several smaller networks. This is often done in
real life.
<p>
Network is being partitioned by setting the 32-bit subnet mask
in which 1's represent the network part, and 0's represent the host
part if IP address. As of now, we may correctly assume that a default
netmask for class B network is 11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000
(in binary, or 255.255.0.0 in dotted quad notation).
<p>
For example, if we are given one class C network (maximum of 254 hosts),
and we want to partition it into 8 networks of 32 hosts per each
subnetwork, we can do it as in the following example:
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
<p>
Let us assume that we are given class C network with address
220.105.101.0.
Initial netmask is set to 255.255.255.0.
To partition this network into 8 subnetworks, we need to take
3 bits from host part of the address (2<sup>3</sup> = 8).
Let's write it in binary:
<p>
Network address 220.105.101.0:
<pre>
 11011100 01101001 01100101 00000000
</pre>
Netmask was 255.255.255.0:
<pre>
 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
</pre>
As we want to have 8 subnetworks (this needs 3 bits from the host part),
netmask will be:
 11111111 11111111 11111111 11100000
or 255.255.255.224 in dotted quad notation.
<p>
Host part of address has shrunk to 5 bits, and we will have new network
address based on 2<sup>5</sup> intervals. Therefore, our new subnetworks will be:
<pre>
 220.105.101.0     220.105.101.32    220.105.101.64    220.105.101.96
 220.105.101.128   220.105.101.160   220.105.101.192   220.105.101.224
</pre>
n.b. The same netmask (255.255.255.224) applies to each of the 8 networks.
<p>
From previous example can be seen that netmask cannot be set on arbitrary
boundary, but rather on addresses that are powers of 2.
<p>
<b>2.2. Configuration guidelines</b>
<p>
As a matter of fact, it doesn't matter whether your network is
class A, B or C. What matters is which subnetwork or part of the
network you want to mask off.
<p>
To determine whether a certain host is within a certain
network, the host's address AND netmask is compared to the
network address.  If they are identical, host is within the
given network.
<p>
<b>Example 1:</b>
Determine whether host 161.53.4.4 is located within the network
161.53.4.0 with netmask 255.255.255.0:
<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=2 width=50%>
<tr>

<pre>
                decimal          binary

host address    161.53.4.4       10100001 00110101 00000100 00000100
netmask         255.255.255.0    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
ANDed           161.53.4.0       10100001 00110101 00000100 00000000

network address 161.53.4.0       10100001 00110101 00000100 00000000
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
since 161.53.4.0 = 161.53.4.0, host is contained within the network.
<p>
<b>Example 2:</b>
<p>
Determine whether the host 161.53.91.7 is located within the network
161.53.91.0 with netmask set to 255.255.255.224

</tr>
</table>
since 161.53.91.0 = 161.53.91.0, host is located within the network.

161.53.91.0 with netmask set to 255.255.255.224

</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
since 161.53.91.96 != 161.53.91.0, host is NOT located within the network.
<p>
To set the netmask properly, and to check the configuration, you must
know what addresses are being covered with certain network address / netmask
combination.
<p>
<b>Example 4:</b>
<P>
Which host are located within the network 161.53.91.0 with netmask set
to 255.255.255.224?

netmask         255.255.255.224  11111111 11111111 11111111 11100000
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
It is obvious that only last 5 bits are host address, since netmask
will mask off upper 3 bits in last octet. Possible host addresses are
from 0 (which cannot be used) up to 00011111 binary, or 31 in decimal.
Therefore, hosts within given network are 161.53.91.1 to 161.53.91.31.
(n.b. with above configuration, we have possible networks:
<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=2 width=50%>

It can be observed that host part is last four bits of the address,
which leads to the netmask of 255.255.255.240.

<h2>16. What is <B>"Counter Terrorism"</B>? And how this program handles it?</h2>
</A>
<blockquote>
If you do not know, in most cases any CGI program can be referred
remotely. For example, a CGI program x.cgi (say it returns an in-lined image) 
in foo.com can be called from foobar.com as follows:
<PRE>
    &lt;img src="http://foo.com/cgi-bin/x.cgi"&gt;
</PRE>
That is, someone somewhere on the  Internet can refer to your counter
and increase the hits and you will not have a clue. You will get the false
impression of many people visiting your page. You can look at the so called
<A HREF="http://www.netaxs.com/people/pudge/"><B>"Counter Terrorist"</B></A>
(looks like this page is dead!) page for demo.
<P>
So how this program handles this? The counter program tries to
get a environment variable called <B>HTTP_REFERER</B> for remote
referer.  It is necessary to check this variable because when someone
remotely refer to a CGI program to your machine, the variable
<B>REMOTE_ADDR</B> will be the address of your machine. So checking
<B>REMOTE_ADDR</B> will not work. Most of the modern browsers returns the
env variable <B>HTTP_REFERER</B>.  If the browser does not return the
variable, counter will be served anyway.  But you are not lost totally
here.  If you decided to ignore count for your host running httpd, the
counter will be served but it will not be increased.  So, I suggest ignore
count for your own host. <b>Gen-conf</b> program is used for generating the
configuration file. The second block is the authentication block, that is
hostname in this block will be able to access the counter remotely as
mentioned about.
<p>
Note this is a simple solution of a complex problem. 
Your feedback is always welcome in this regard.

<B>1. My CGI scripts don't work. What's wrong?</B><p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Answer: </b><font size=-1>
Simply linking from your page to an executable program or script won't
cause it to be run by the server. There are two common arrangements: either
files in directories specially designated by the server administrator are
executed as CGI scripts, or files with a special extension (such as .cgi)
are executed as CGI scripts. 
<p>
These are just two possible ways your server might be configured. Many
sites don't allow users to run CGI scripts at all. Consult your web
server's administrator.

<b>3. Why does the counter show "888888" all the time?</b>
<blockquote>
<font size=-1>
<b>Answer:</b>The counter is running in strict mode
(look at <i>count.cfg</i> file).  When the counter runs in strict mode, if
the browser does not return the environment variable <b>HTTP_REFERER</b>,
the counter will display the image <b>888888</b> instead of serving the
counter.  The env variable HTTP_REFERER should contain the web page running
the counter. Some browesers does not return this variable in &lt;img GET
method.  This feature guarantees that the counter can not be accessed
remotely to mess up the datafile from a browser like yours.  Some entries
in the log file are made including the browser type.
