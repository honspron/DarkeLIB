The DarkeMUD war will be a mudwide war where everyone fights.
You will suffer no penalties of death.  It is just for fun
and pride etc...  See who is the kewlest.  This will happen
twice a day when reboots come.  I have seen war systems on
many other muds and I actually like them... so we have to 
have one.  I will outline a little of what we have planeed 
for the war system.

<OL>
<LI>  It will happen twice a day as I said after reboots.
<LI>  There will be individual wars, team wars, and guild wars.
<LI>  There will be some kind of prize. (That is up in the air)
<LI>  All shops will be closed, castles will be locked off,
    you will not be able to use your pets.
<LI>  There will be a 15-20 min prep time where you can cast
    spells, kill stuff on the mud for equip, and spend
    war-money at the war shop.
<LI>  There will be various items you can buy there and armours
    & weapons. 
<LI>  A) Ind wars.... everyone for themselves!
<BR>    B) Guild wars... the guild left standing wins.
       Every member in the winning guild who is still alive
       will get something.
<BR>    C) Team wars... Team wars will be divided with the top
       tanks and mages divided evenly to the teams.  You
       can form parties in team wars!  The living memebers
       in the winning team gets some prize.
</OL>
<BR>
This is just a rough outline...  It will be more specific 
when we get ready to code it.
