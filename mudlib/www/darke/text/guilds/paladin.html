<HR>
   Paladins are semi-spell users who concentrate heavily in chivalric
combat.  The Paladin is the epitome of Arthurian knighthood.  Names
like Lancelot, Gawain, and especially Galahad should come to mind.
He is a heavy weapons and heavy armour specialist.  The Paladin
should be played carefully in regard to moral style as any variance
from his convictions turns his great strength into bloody hypocrisy.
