   The Chaotic Lord is a semi-spell user who specializes in the 
manipulation of chaos.  The Chaotic Lord serve only one "master";
they live and die for the honor of the "master" and the master's 
house.  The few Chaotic Lords that have betrayed their masters are
rumored to have suffered slow and painful deaths.  The Chaotic Lord
by choice is deformed and mutilated as an expression of their total
loyality to their "master".  No two Chaotic Lords are the same; a
Chaotic Lord is a power to be feared.
<BR><BR>   The Chaotic Lord must accept a geas when taking on his Chaotic
Armour;  this is another instance of complete obedience to their
"master".  When a Chaotic Lord dies attempting to control or
master Chaotic Armour, other Chaotic Lords only acknowledge the
deed by announcing that the other was unworthy scum that tried to
pass as one of the chosen.
