<HR>
    The High Warrior Monk is a "fanatic" martial artist who has been
brought up in a relatively isolated and restrictive environment
dedicated to martial arts and personal disipline.  This intensive 
background leads to relatively low skill development costs in the 
martial arts and related skills, but relaticely high costs for
unrelated skills.
