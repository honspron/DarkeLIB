   A varient of the Cleric, a Elementalist is a pure 
elemental spell user that worships a "diety level" 
elemental intelligence- for each element is an elemental
being whose powers are like unto a god.  A "supreme elemental"
is usually intested in only one thing: the proliferation of his
element throughout the planes, and an Elementalist works towards
this end.  A supreme elemental seeks to dominate places with his
element; thus, supreme elementals are in constant conflict.

P.S.  Elementalists are a very unique guild among magic users, in that
each of their spells represents actually several spells in one.  How
is this?  In addition to training in elementalism, the skill necessary
to cast elemental spells, elementalists must also train in one or
more elemental lore skills (e.g., fire lore, ice lore, chaos lore)
in order to cast the spell using that element.  To switch elements,
you type 'use <skill>' where the skill is the lore skill you want
to use to cast spells.  Some elements are more deadly that others,
and they cost more to train and are availiable only at higher levels.
