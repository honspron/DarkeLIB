<HR>

   Those familiar with fantasy worlds, and ancient history in 
general, quickly recognize the figure of the Barbarian: roughly
& scantily clad, powerfully built, and with real savvy of the
outdoors.  The Barbarian is a non-spell user even more unfamiliar
with magic than the Fighters.  He is an extremely powerful weapons
specialist, second only to the Fighter.  Barbarians, however, barely
tolerate armor, and prefer instead to defend themselves with their
skills, quick defensive reactions, and intimate familiarity with 
the wilds.
