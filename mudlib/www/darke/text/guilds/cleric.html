<HR>
   A Cleric's path is highly influenced by his god and 
many patterns in his life are formed by his religious traning.  
The difference between a Cleric of a war god and one of a god
should be readly apparent.  Not only should the two behave
differently, reflecting the tenets of their respective religions,
but they should have greatly divergent skills.
