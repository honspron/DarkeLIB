<BR>
Sylphs are beautiful, humanoid women with wings like dragonflies.  Their
wings are 4-5 feet long and translucent, clear or spotted with iridescent
color.  Their long bright hair may be and 'normal' color, or blue, purple,
or green.  They wear flowing diaphanous robes which accent their wings
or hair.  Sylphs are related to air elementals and to nymphs, perhaps
originating as a cross between nymphs and aerial servants.  Sylphs
can speak common and their own musical language.
