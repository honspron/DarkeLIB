<H3>Ent</H3>

<HR>
<BR>

	The Ents arose from early magical experimentation in the area of 
adding the capacity for thought and movement to plant life.  The 
experiments were firghteningly successful and gave rise to one of the 
longest-lived and wisest races in the lands of Darkemud.  An ent appears 
exactly as it is: a tall, mobile tree, with four large branches used for 
manipulation, and four roots used for mobility.  Ents' strength and tough 
bark make them fierce in combat, and their extreme wisdom lends them good 
spellcasting ability, particularly in the clerical genre.
<BR>	Note that ents have no true hands or feet, and therefore cannot
wear boots or gloves.
