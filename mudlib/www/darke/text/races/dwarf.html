    Legend and song assert the Dwarves to have been born of stone,
naming them as Sons and Daughters of Earth.  They are a stalwart
people, comfortable below ground, where they delve labyrinthe mines
and palatial dwellings.  Dwarves are masters of metalcraft.  Their
works are beautiful as well as durable.  Full of ridicule for the
ways of conjurers, they employ such magics only to enhance the 
powers of the weapons and artifacts reluctantly released from their
forges.  Dwarves are short stocky with ruddy complexions.  The men
grow long beards which they often braiid.  Infertility combined with 
a lack of females leads few Dwarves to marry or conceicve young.
Dwarves favor colorful, hooded clothing and hanf arms.  Many are
proficient with standard bows, but a likingfor mechanical devices 
prompts them to employ cross bows when a need for missile weapons
arises.
