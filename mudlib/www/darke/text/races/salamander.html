<BR>
Salamanders are natives of the elemental plane of Fire, and thus they thrive
in hot places.  These cruel, evil creatures come to the Prime Material plane
for reasons only known to them.  The head and torso of a salamander is
copper-colored and has a human-like appearance.  Most of the time, this
aspect is a male, with a flaming beard and moustache.  The female version
has flowing, fiery red hair.  Both aspects have glowing yellow eyes that
sometimes switch to fluorescent green.  Salamanders usually carry a shiny
metal spear.  The lower torso is that of a large snake, with orange coloring
shading to dull red at the tail end.  The entire body is covered with
wispy appendages that appear to burn but are never consumed.
