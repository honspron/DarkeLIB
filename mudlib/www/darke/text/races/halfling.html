    Shallow burrows bug into hillsides comprise the majority
of residences in Halfling villages; although their are some
small cottages to provide taverns or inns for local meeting 
places.  All of these structures tend to have round windows
or doorrs, like portholes, and are painted in bright colors.
Halflings prefer the ease and quiet of a sedentary liffe, 
avoiding the exccitement and danger that accompany adventure. 
Love of good food and drink leands them to spend much of their 
time at taverns and friends` homes, eating and growing fat.
Despite plumpness, Halflings can move very quietly and possess
exceedingly nimble fingers.  Their large feet are very hairy,
almost furry, and immune to cold; Halflings rarely wear shoes.
Their garments tend to be bright and colorful, like their houses,
for Halflings are merry folk, full of gauety and ready to enjoy
life's bounty.
