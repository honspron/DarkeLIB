These creatures are from the elemental plane of Water, sometimes called
"honeyed ones," are unpredictable and playful; hald are chaotic neutral while
others tend towards good or evil.  Nereids are invisible in water but upon
contact with air, they assume human form, usually as voluptuous young females
with long golden hair, pearly white skin, and sparkling green eyes.  Their
voices and songs are lovely.  A nereid always carries a little white shawl,
either in its hands or over head and shoulders, and is lightly clad in white
and gold.
