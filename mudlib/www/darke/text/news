     We are having more toubles than anticipated configuring our lib to be
compatible with the new driver, mainly due to an unanticipated driver bug
which we are trying to resolve. Hopefully we will be back up in a few more
days, BUT I am considering staying closed until we can open fully.  In
that case I will most likely NOT take 1/2 your levels, more like 1/3, or
maybe just 1/2 your exp.  Also, I will make sure you do not lose any items
in your chets or safes or any pets you have in inns or castles. Runes may
be lost however.

     I have decided to keep the mud closed until we are ready to open.  I 
will make sure everyone still has all their stuff, and I will allow a 
week long grace period in which thieves may not steal chests or forges so 
you may rebuild your castle.  In addition, I have decided to reduce all 
players to 1/2 EXP, not LEVEL.  In most cases, this will mean losing 
between 2 and 4 levels, less if you are a newbie.

     Since many of you have been asking, we project we will be opening
in less than a month, probably about three weeks, around mid to late May.
I will post a more accurate date when we have one.
