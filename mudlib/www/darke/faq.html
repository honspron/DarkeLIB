	 IMPORTANT:  This is an advanced mud.  It is extremely complex
     in several ways that will become obvious as you play.  We do 
not 
     advise that you play this mud if you have never mudded 
before, as 
     we have coded it with the seasoned mudder in mind.  If this 
is your
     first mud, good luck, you can expect to die EXTREMELY often. 
 This
     mud is largely combat-oriented, and experienced or not, you 
can 
     expect to die more here than on most other muds.  Because of 
this, the
     penalties of death are mild.<P>

         This mud has one domain.  It is a fantasy mud with the 
theme
     of The Lost and the Damned.   More specific... It is a dark, 
evil 
     mud...  Kinda a Gotham City from Batman, but fantasy.  The 
main
     city is reminiscent of Menzobarranzen from The Underdark, 
but above
     ground.  Beautiful, dark, and deadly.  This theme carries 
     over the whole mud.  Now it doesn't all have to be this 
dark.  There 
     has to be good somewhere.  There are no dumb monsters, 
     weapons, etc. like a toy top or water pistol.  Things must 
stick to
     a medieval theme.<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME = "races">Races</A></H4>
         We try to have a variety of races on Darke.  Races get 
     bonuses to stats and they can have special abilities.  Ex: 
faster 
     healing, natural weaponry, etc... The races are unbalanced,  
so 
     we balance the races by putting an experience modifier on 
the exp 
     they gain.  Negative or positive.  Some races are very 
versatile
     and others are only suited for one type of guild.  Select 
your race 
     carefully to suit the type of guild you wish to be a part 
of.  Help
     races for more information.<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME = "stats">Stats</A></H4>
         There are six stats on Darke.  Str, Con, Wis, Int, Dex, 
and 
     Chr.  Stats are from 1-106.  Stats can later be modified by 
races, 
     items, and other things.  I love those technical terms like 
things.
     The stats tell how many development points you will have.
     (Unmodified except for racial mods)  Stats do not increase
     when you go up save by magic or items.  Stats also give 
bonuses 
     to skills and are considered the base.  You must have 
trained 
     once in the skill to be able to use it.<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME = "guilds">Guilds</A></H4>
        There are many guilds in Darke.  Guilds are an important 
part 
    of Darke.  First, guild unity is very big here.  There will 
be a guild 
    master and guild represenatives.  You must be invited into 
the 
    guild by one of them.  Some guilds lean towards soloing while 

    others lean towards partying.  Try to match your guild with 
your 
    race.  Help guilds for more information.<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME = "exp">Experience</A></H4>
         Experience is gained a couple of ways: killing monsters, 

     critical hits, quests.  You get a bonus for getting mass 
exp.  I.E. 
     killing a bad ass monster.  Experience is only used for 
raising 
     your level, not for skills/spells and of course you don't 
raise your 
     stats.  Level costs do vary between guilds.<P>

<HR>         
<H4><A NAME = "adv">Development / Advancement</A></H4>
          As I said earlier development points are gained by 
stats 
     except for charisma.  The higher the stat, the more dev 
points 
     you get.  Each level you get more dev points.  There are two 

     ways to spend dev points. 1) Slow development: It is a base
     cost for a skill which you can raise once per level.  2) 
Fast 
     development:  Fast dev costs double slow dev.  You can fast 
     dev all the dev points you have.  There is no limit unlike 
slow 
     dev.  The dev costs for skills are a flat rate.  Follow this
     chart.  So until you hit 60 in the skill (unmodified) each 
time 
     you slow dev it raises by five.  And so on.<P>
<UL>

<LI>     0-60 by 5's
<LI>     60-80 by 2's
<LI>     80 and up by 1's
<LI>	 Cost DOUBLES after 100.
</UL>     

     <A HREF = "http://www.shadowlands.com/home/WWW/darke/spellsys.html">
Spells</A> are raised similar to skills, but the dev point cost 
is 
     cumulative.  There are skills to cast spells etc...<P>

     NOTE: All skills are modified by a certain stat which 
depends on the
     skill itself.<P>

     To list your skills, type 'skills' or 'skills base' for base 
skills.
     To list your spells, type 'spells'<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME = "combat"><A HREF = 
"http://www.shadowlands.com/darke/combat.html">Combat</A></A></H4>
          When you attack you can get a critical hit.  This 
critical hit is randomly 
     roled on a chart which has fun effects.  It can do little or
     kill instantly.  It can cripple limbs and cause other ill 
effects.  
     There are many different critical damages to support our 
many 
     different damage types.  There are also many modifications 
to 
     the combat, such as multiple hits etc.  Here is a quick list 
of 
     some of the things the combat system  supports.  
     This list is off the top of my head.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Limb support
<LI>Dodge, parry, and blocking...also bare-hand blocking(but 
tough)
<LI>Dual weapon attacking, multiply attacks
<LI>Specific weapon support
<LI>Penalty for using off hand (ambidextrous races are nice)
<LI>Lots of other cool shit, but I forgot
</UL>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME = "law">Law</A></H4>
         The law is run by players.  Wizards do not interfere.  
There is a 
     council of the guildmasters.  They enforce the laws through 
the 
     guilds.  If a guy gets out of hand as a player killer,. 
players will 
     be expected to take care of it.  NOTE!!! Player killing is 
NOT 
     restricted on this mud!  Anyone can kill whomever they 
please without
     the wizzes getting involved.  The guild is expected to 
provide support
     for its members.  If a lower-level player in your guild is 
getting p/k'ed
     or stolen from or whatever, you are expected to intervene on 
his or 
     her behalf, or face the wrath of the guildmaster.  Because 
of this, the
     wizzes DO NOT LIKE whining!  If you whine to us about how 
hard a time
     you are having, you will get one of the following:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Talk to your guildmaster.
<LI>Play an easier mud.
</OL>
     HOWEVER, if the guildmaster of your guild is either 
consistently
     unavailable or refuses to do his or her job effectively, we 
will
     intervene, but ONLY THEN.<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME = "economy">Economy</A></H4>
	 Eventually, the economy will be run almost entirely by players.
     For now, all players may do is buy shops at certain 
locations in the 
     town and sell whatever they wish for a predetermined 
mark-up.  These
     items could range from things the player makes to valuable 
items obtained
     from killing monsters or completing quests.<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME = "storage">Item Storage</A></H4>
	 Currently, the only way to save items past a reboot is to rent
     a room at the inn.  You must also buy a chest or other 
container
     which is specially designed to carry items past reboots and 
place it
     in your room.  THE CHEST MUST BE CLOSED OR IT MAY NOT 
SAVE!!!
     In the future, player castles will be implemented, and items 
may
     be stored there.<P>

<HR>
<H4><A NAME = "comm">Communication</A></H4>

<H5>Languages:</H5>
	 All characters can speak their racial tongue fluently from the 
     start of the game.  To see the various racial tongues, type
     'tongues'.  In addition, everyone starts with a skill in 
Common that
     depends on intelligence.  Use this language when speaking to 
players
     not belonging to your race.  To see what languages are 
available to 
     you, type 'languages'.  Note that if you try to speak or 
hear a language
     in which you are not fluent, you may say or hear certain 
things 
     incorrectly.  Note that you learn languages automatically 
(and rather
     slowly) just by listening to it spoken.  To change the 
language
     you are speaking, type 'speak [language]'.<P>
	 
     In several instances, you will be called upon to talk to 
NPC's or
     monsters.  You may do this with either the say or tell 
commands.
     If you use the say command, be sure to speak a language 
known 
     to the NPC, and address it with its name followed by a 
comma...<P>

	say whoever, blah blah blah.<P>

     If you have the mp, using the tell command is often more 
convenient,
     since it is not subject to language...see 'help 
communication' for
     details.<P>

   	 In addition, the players have access to their guild channel, 
which
     may be accessed by typing the channel name followed by a 
message.  
     Players level 3 and under also have access to the newbie 
channel.
     You may view which channels you have access to with the 
'lines'
     command.  Typing a channel name alone toggles it on and off.
<P>

<h4><A NAME = "tips">Playing Tips</a></h4>

As mentioned before, DarkeMUD is extremely difficult, especially
for the novice.  For this reason, we suggest you help yourself
out as much as you can.  Here are a few tips:


<UL>
<LI>Make lots of friends.  You will need powerful allies to make it.
<LI>Use a terminal that supports color!  Color has been added to bring
out the important messages in combat etc. that often get lost.
<LI>Pick a good 
<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se:7500/mud/faq/faq2.html">MUD client
</a> or term program.  The macros and buffers can
save you.
<UL>
<LI>There are several good 
<a href="http://www.rahul.net/galen/client.html">
Winsock MUD clients</a> for windows
