Combat in darkeMUD is both entertaining and deadly. It will <br>
require some getting used to before you can go up against difficult <br>
monsters without fear of instant death. At its most basic level, combat <br>
consists of 2 second turns in which every participant in combat gets a<br>
chance to hit. How many hits you get depends on several things which we <br>
will discuss later. Combat takes place automatically, and the only way <br>
to end it is to flee. You may flee manually by typing a direction <br>
command (n, s, e, w, etc.) to get out of the room, or you may set <br>
yourself to flee automatically if your hp is low.<br>
Be careful, some monsters will attack on sight!<br>
<br>
<br>
<big>Initiating Combat</big><br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
You may start combat with any monster or player by typing 'kill <br>
&lt;who&gt;', where who is the name of what you wish to kill. Note that once <br>
you 'kill' something, you will ALWAYS attack each other on sight until <br>
one of you dies or logs off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big>To-Hit Chance</big><br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
Of course, in order to damage your opponent, you must hit him or <br>
her. Your chance of doing so depends on a number of factors.<br>
<br>
If you are wielding one or more weapons:<br>
1) Your skill with the weapon(s) -- using a weapon with which you have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no skill incurrs a SERIOUS penalty.<br>
2) The hand in which you wield the weapon...unless your race is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is ambidextrous, you hit much better with the limb you favor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the 'score' command to see what it is.<br>
3) How many weapons you are wielding. Wielding more than one weapon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also incurrs a serious penalty, though you may attack with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both of them at once.<br>
4) How well you can see in the room (how dark is it?)<br>
<br>
NOTE: Certain higher-level skills can offset the penalties for<br>
attacking with multiple or offhand weapons.<br>
<br>
If you are attacking bare-handed:<br>
1) Your melee skill.<br>
2) Your martial arts skill, if any.<br>
3) How well you can see.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big>Hit Points and Damage</big><br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
Every player and monster has a certain amount of hit points (hp), <br>
of which they must be deprived if they are to die. In addition, every <br>
living thing has a body, and certain limbs may take damage and be <br>
severed. The effects of severed limbs depends on the limb...you may not <br>
fly without wings, fight without arms, walk without legs, etc. In <br>
addition, your head may be severed, allowing you to die before you lose <br>
all of your hp. There are also several other ways to die without having <br>
your hp reduced to zero, and, perhaps even worse, several ways to have <br>
your hp reduced by a great amoiunt in one blow!<br>
<br>
The amount of damage you do in combat is based on your weapon<br>
and how good it is. Certain skills are capable of ascertaining the<br>
quality of weapons. Most of the time, you can expect not to have<br>
more than ten hit points done to you even on a good hit, but there<br>
are SEVERAL exceptions. If you are attacking bare-handed, damage is <br>
based only on your strength, melee skill, and martial arts skill, if any.<br>
<br>
Damage may be prevented by armour. Armour is a necessity if you <br>
wish to fight difficult monsters without being instantly slain. Several <br>
different types of armour are available, all with different merits. Most <br>
of them are pretty much self explanatory, for instance, leather armour is <br>
great against cutting weapons, but watch out for clubs and maces. Plate <br>
is good against most weapons, but electrical spells can still make your <br>
day. Several spells also provide protection against damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big>Critical Hits</big><br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
The better a weapon is and the better your skill with it, the <br>
greater the chance of incurring a critical hit. The results of the <br>
critical hit depend on the weapon you are using (or melee and martial arts <br>
skill if no weapon), your skill with that weapon, and your opponent's <br>
armour. For instance, crushing weapons often stun opponents, while <br>
cutting weapons tend to lacerate and sometimes even lop off limbs. On <br>
extremely arre occasions, critical hits can kill outright! You will <br>
notice that this is not so rare is you try to attack a particularly <br>
awesome monster with no armour!<br>
<br>
Basically, the critical hit system is a large part of what makes <br>
combat on DarkeMUD so colorful. There are probably upwards of several <br>
thousand possible critical hit results with more on the way. Hopefully, <br>
you will find ways of exploiting critical hits to do your bidding, but I <br>
haven't figured out how to, so good luck!<br>
<br>
<br>
<big>Thrown Weapons</big><br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
Some weapons (daggers, hand axes, etc.) may be thrown. To do <br>
this, merely type: <br>
<br>
throw &lt;weapon&gt; at &lt;target&gt;<br>
<br>
You lose the weapon by doing this, but hits inflict much more damage than <br>
just wielding the weapon, and there is a greater chance of inflicting a <br>
critical hit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big>Experience</big><br>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
You gain experience through combat. However, this does not happen<br>
instantly. While fighting, the experience accumulates in your mind,<br>
causing your mind status to change (from 'clear' to 'full of facts';<br>
you can see your mind status with the score command).<br>
Your mind capacity (how much experience you can store) depends<br>
on your level, and does not depend on stats like Int, or Wis.<br>
Experience accumulated in your mind is processed slowly, becoming<br>
real, permanent experience. This has the following effects:<br>
1. You will stop receiving experience from kills if your mind is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full.<br>
2. You will see your real experience increase for some time after a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fight.<br>
3. You might have to wait a little for the last bits of experience<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be processed before you level, even if you have killed enough<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monsters to advance.</strong></p>
