Revised 10/13/96

This is a list that I will be expanding as I talk to more of you.
I want to start keeping a list of all ongoing work for the mud
so that we can get a good idea of what's up and coming.
We'll try to keep this list updated from now on with estimated
completion and new projects as they are assigned.
