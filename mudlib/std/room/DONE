	* senses.c- Reduced the number of functions in senses.c so that 
	there simply are: set_smell() set_search() set_listen() 
	remove_smell() remove_search() remove_listen() query_smell() 
	query_search() query_listen(). This should save on RAM and make 
	coding life easier on newbie coders (even older coders will 
	appreciate having to know fewer function names to do the same 
	thing). Second arg to the set_*() functions maybe either of type 
	string or type function. Also created /include/old_room.h for 
	the sake of backwards compat.
