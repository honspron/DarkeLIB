/daemon

The directory for non-secure daemons.



What is the difference between a secure daemon and a non-secure daemon?

A secure one is one which can be used to seriously violate the mud's security

such that only administrators should be accessing it.  For greater

productivity in mudlib building, the more of your mud functions your arches

can access, the more can be done.  But the other side of the coin is

that the more functions they can access, the more damage they can do

either maliciously or accidentally.  The non-secure daemons are thus

those which are not vital to mud security or whose failure to load

will cause the mud to go down.



This does not mean let anyone have access to this directory.  With access

to this directory, you can forge mail, screw with the inetmud setup,

make shops and bars not work, break the chat lines, etc.  As you can

tell from the access file, the difference between secure daemons and

non-secure ones is that all arches can have access to non-secure ones but

only administration to secure ones.



This directory is divided up into three parts:

1) The daemons which constitute the bulk of the directory

2) /daemon/save which is where most of the daemons save themselves

3) /daemon/db which is where databases for the daemons are stored
