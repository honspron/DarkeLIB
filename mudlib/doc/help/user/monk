	Monks concentrate upon spells and skills which relate
to their bodies. They are semi spell casters whose base spells
deal with personal movement and the control of their body and 
mind. Their arms capabilities are concentrated in unarmed, 
unarmoured combat. These martial warriors do not rely on heavy 
armor or weapons and are always prepared for combat.
