		Do's and dont's of Khell
		*------------------------------*


1)Never ask "Are you busy?" or your response will be "Yes now leave me alone"
2)Don't pester me for rez's, reinc's, reimb's, or anything else starting with 'r' cause I aint doing it!
3)Never send me E-MAIL asking for help on levels, quests, area's, items, or anything else. Or the magic fairy whispers it to the security arch! BTW you have no clue what E-MAIL is
4)Don't bother me for free eq, money, or items, as I like my job here and like seeing you play here. IE- grounds for ridding by the big bad Shadowraith
5)Don't send me tells, if it is a bug use the bug command, we put it there for that reason. If it's on silly crap I just might grumble at you for awhile, if it's anything above, hope you liked it here
6)I will not, cannot, and don't wanna help you. Your a mortal I am not. I have no want for you. Ask someone who does
7)I am NEVER going to give you someone's location, so don't ask!

Yea no do's, there aren't any I don't wanna speak with you. 

**Don't like these rules? Sorry, I don't care.
