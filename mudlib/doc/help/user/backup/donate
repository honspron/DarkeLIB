Ok, here is the deal... we have a 686-166 with 64 megs now.
We also have a PCI 3COM network card which we just got.  
Now we are working on another 64 megs of mem.  After that
we should be pretty set.  We are hitting around 90 users
online now and the mem is disappearing.  Also clan system
is now up and is taking up more mem.  So basically we need
some mem.

You receive no exp or anything for donation.  This mud is
not a pay mud... it is free.  That is why it is called a 
donation and not a fee!  Donating a few bucks is nothing
when you consider how much time you play it.  We also 
have put in the thousands of hours into making this mud, so
you can play it.  All the admin has also donated a ton of cash
to the computer too.  We are continuing to expand and make the
mud better, so hang in there.  Generally people have been
donating 20-50 dollars. 

In tranquility square there is a list of the founders and the people
who have donated to DarkeMUD.
