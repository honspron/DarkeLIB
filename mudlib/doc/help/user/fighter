	Fighters are the primary arms specialists. They are 
warriors and are experts in weapons, as well as tactics and 
strategy. Fighters find it very easy to develop a variety of
different weapons and to wear heavier types of armour. They
are less skilled at maneuvering and manipulating mechanical
devices such as locks and traps and have the greatest
difficulty with anything connected with spells.
