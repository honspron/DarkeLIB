		    =-=-=- Cleric -=-=-=

	A Cleric's path is highly influenced by his god and
many patterns in his life are formed by his religious training.
The difference between a Cleric of a war god and one of a god
should be readily apparent. Not only should the two behave
differently, but they should have greatly divergent skills.
	The Cleric can be considered the adventurers of their
faith. Unlike their passive priestly brothers, they go abroad
and actively spread their faith, as well as combatting enemies
to their faith.
