		  =-=-=- Elemental-Warrior -=-=-=

	A rather unique character, the Elemental-Warrior is more
than just a simple variant of the warrior-mage. This character is
powerful in his own field. Unlike Elementalists, who have dedicated
their lives and service to a an elemental diety, the Elem-Warrior
has made a pact with the elemental spirits. The spirits he serves
are to the supreme dieties of the elementalists as dark is to light.
While the elementalist dieties care only about propogating their
elements and destroying all else, the elemental spirits are
concerned with the geometric balance of nature.
	Each Elemental-Warrior is a skilled warrior in his own right.
He then pledges to maintain the balance of the elements and makes a
pact with an elemental spirit, who lends him its powers. He gains
attacks and augmentations from his element, but must constantly 
strive to maintain the balance against other Elem-Warriors as well
as Elementalists of the other elements.

Examples: Ever see the anime Elementalors? If not-imagine a character
	skilled in the martial arts, who can release blasts of pure
	elemental energy, and elemental effects.
Comments: Elemental-Warriors are like wandering Druids in their 
	purpose, but instead of being neutral, are more inclined to 
	listen to nature for the balance. They are very active 
	warriors. Plus, like Elementalists, each ability they recieve
	is able to be used in each of the elements. However, unlike
	Elementalists who recieve spells from their dieties, the
	Elemental Warriors recieve abilities from their bonded
	elemental spirits. As a result, they recieve 'powers' instead
	of spells. These 'powers' drain from the same source as spells
	and use mp, but are very powerful and require large amounts.
