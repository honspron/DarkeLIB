		    =-=-=- Moon-Mage -=-=-=

	The Moon-Mage is a type of spell caster different
from the other wizard guilds. He specializes in the 
manipulation of moon magic. Moon magic emphasizes the
changing states of the moons: and a Moon-Mage's power ebbs 
and flows with the phases of the moons.

Type:   Phase Spell Caster
Skills: Limited combat
Spells: The most spells of any guild
Prime Attributes: Int, Wis

Examples: Similar to historic druids, whose rituals reflected the
	balance of nature, the cycles of the stars and moons.
Comments: These mages are very unique. They have various spells,
	whose power and effects fluctuate with the moon. These
	mages are very interesting to play, with constantly
	shifting abilities. Spells may be coded which will have
	completely opposite effects when cast depending on the
	orientations of the moons.
