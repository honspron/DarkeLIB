Long-term skills and spells
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Many skills and spells are powerful and take several minutes to a 
few hours of real time to complete.  These spells and skills are known 
as "long-term."  They all have the following in common:

	- They must all be used / cast on something or someone (never
	  no target).
	- They are interrupted if either the caster or the target moves.
	- If they are interrupted, simply re-casting the spell or re-using
	  the skill will pick up where the efforts were left off.
	- Incomplete items may be stored just like any other item over
	  reboots.
	- In the case of spells, if you re-cast the spell on an incomplete
	  item, it must be no greater than the power of the last casting,
	  but it can be less.  Effectively, upon re-casting, you may reduce,
	  but not increase, the power of the spell.

An example of the above would be weapon forge skill, available to 
tinkers.  The skill is used on a weapon blank, and may take quite a 
while.  The tinker would type:

use weapon forge at weapon blank with long-sword

to start forging the weapon blank into a long-swrd.  Every so often, the 
tinker will see:

You bang on the weapon blank, forging it carefully.
Time left 0:34:56

The 'Time left' is in hour:min:sec.  If at any time the tinker or 
sword-blank moves:

You interrupt your work.

At any future time, the tinker may resume his/her work by typing the same 
line:

use weapon forge at weapon blank with long-sword


NOTE: Some long-term skills/spells will take so long that it will be 
impractical or impossible to use the skill or spell if you are not 
equipped to save items past reboots.  This is intentional.
