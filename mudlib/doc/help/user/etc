Etc -- et cetera; often used to direct your thoughts toward
continuing to persue a previously defined train of facts in
the effort of avoiding meaningless dribble of mouth, and the
waste of valued oxygen required by all animals to live and
thus acting as a force for conservation of natural resourses
towards the betterment of human kind, whithout which there
would be no reason to mud, leading consequently to the lack
of a need for adminstrators and developers of muds--calling
into jepordy the reason for some of us to live and then getting
a real life that then will no doubt polute the environment or
corrupt the morality of some helpless farm animal that only
wanted to eat grass and go "baaa"...

SO THEREFORE READ THE DAMN DOCS AND ASK OTHER PLAYERS FIRST!
Or do you want to be responsible for the end of humankind?
