	Rangers are those who have pledged to protect and
maintain the wilds of nature. Unlike druids, who maintain a
strict neutral policy, or the elemental based guilds who
either seek to disrupt or maintain the elemental balance,
rangers protect the wilds out of a sense of responsibility.
The appreciate the beauty of nature for its own sake, and
many worship the gods of such places.
