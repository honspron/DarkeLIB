		    =-=-=- Chaotic-Lord -=-=-=

	The Chaotic-Lord is a semi-spell casting warrior who
specializes in the manipulation and control of chaos. The Chaotic-
Lord serves only one "master"; and lives and dies for the honor of
the "master" and the master's house. The few Chaotic-Lords who 
have betrayed their masters are rumored to have suffered slow and
painful deaths. No two Chaotic-Lords are the same, and they are
to be feared.
	The Chaotic-Lord must accept a geas when taking his/her
Chaotic Armour; this is another instance of complete obedience to
the "master". When a Chaotic-Lord dies attempting to master the
Armour, other Lords only acknowledge the deed by announcing that
the other was unworthy scum that tried to pass as one of the chosen.
