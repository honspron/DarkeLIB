Getting Help
 
Hmm, the word doesn't seem to be getting out, so Ill make sure everyone
understand....
 
If you do not see a wiz or arch online, theneither we arent online or
we are invisible.  If we are invisible, it is because we don't want
to be disturbed, for whatever reason, coding...hiding, whatever.
 
If visible, you may ask the wiz/arch your question directly...please do
not start with "Do you have a moment?" or "Can I ask you a question?"
Just dive in with something like, "Excuse me, i get a message saying my
head is missing, can you help me?".  Please read help administration 
first so that you address your question to the appropraite level wiz.
Ie dont ask a Wizard level guy for a reincarnation, only mentors and
above can grant those, and all wizards mentor level and above are
listed in the help file by name.
 
If we are invisible, you may ask for help on chat by saying "I have
an emergency, could an arch help me?"  If it is an emergency, good
if not, woe unto thee.  If its not an emergency either mail the 
appropriate wizard, mai arch, or mail me.  If its a request for
special favors, then mail me, I make thos decisions.  Emergencies
are situations that affect the mud as a whole (severe abusable bug)
or that prevents you from playing AT ALL in your current situation.
 
Hope this clarifies things.
