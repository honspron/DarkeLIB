The following commands help anyone communicate:
    tell    say    shout    yell    reply

In addition, the following player channels exist which help in communication:
    guild    class    newbie

There are several instances where you will need to communicate with
non-player characters (NPC's) like shopkeepers.

TALKING TO NPC's: tell <npc> <whatever> or say <npc>, <whatever>
	or yell <npc>, <whatever>  (yell is heard in adjacent rooms)
		   Example: tell shopkeeper sell sword
			    say shopkeeper, sell sword.
		   BE SURE to use the comma.
	Often, you will be able to get help from npc's by asking
	for 'help':
		tell shopkeeper help
		say shopkeeper, help

        If there are several NPC's of the same name in a room, for
	example several identical summoned creatures, you may single
	out one of them like this:
		say elemental 2, attack turkey
	Also, if you want to address all of an identical group at the
	same time, for instance to get all of them to attack one
	creature simultaneously, do this:
		say elementals, attack turkey
	NOTE: You may only use say or yell (not tell) to do both of
	the above, since tell may only be used to address a single
	creature, and 'tell elemental 1 blah blah' is not supported.

Also, if you are using 'tell', the npc may or may not understand your
language...speaking common is a good way to get out of that, though
some npc's speak many languages.

Type <help [command]> to find out more about each.
Do not type the <> or [].
<> means what is enclosed is the command.
[] means that you do not use the word command literally, but substitute the
    appropriate command name.
