		     =-=-=- Thief -=-=-=

	Thieves are specialists at maneuvering and
manipulating. Thieves rarely wear heavy armour, which limit
their maneuverability. These non spell casting warriors 
train in skills relying upon their fast reflexes and 
dexterous movements. Hiding in shadows, skillfully slitting
a purse, and the thrill of the chase are trademarks of the
rogue guild.
