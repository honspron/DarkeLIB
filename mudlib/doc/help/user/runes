Runes
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
    Runes are magical enscriptions placed on the floor of a room.
Anyone stepping into the room, who does not save, undergoes the 
effects of the rune.  The caster is immune to this.  The rune WILL NOT
affect those in the room at the time of casting, unless the leave and
come back.  You may, however, 'delay' the rune ('help spell delay
rune') in order to cuase it to go off, affecting all present.
    If at any time you wish to erase a rune, you may with the
command 'erase rune <rune>' where <rune> is the name
of the rune you wish to erase.
