These are the rules for playing a chharacter while having a wiz
on Darke
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1.  ALL characters, including test characters must be registered.
In order to register a player or testchar, use the 'wizchar'
command.  See 'help wizchar' for its use.  If we find that you have
been playing an unregistered character, both will be deleted and
banished, and the site will be blocked.

2.  If you are a Wizard (this include the positions: wiz, wizard, 
creator), then you are allowed to play with your player (you may only 
have one) for up to HALF the time you are on with your wiz.  If this time 
is exceeded and not rectified in a week, the wiz will be deleted.

3.  Test characters may under NO circumstances interact with players.  
Doing so will result in banishment of wiz and testchar, plus deletion and 
site blocking.

4. If you are an Elder, you can playt EQUAL time to the time spent on 
with your wiz.  Penalties are identical to item #2.

5.  We may or may not mail you if you are subject to deletion.  To be 
safe, read the file /log/wizchar_time if you hacve access, or ask an arch 
to.  Dont worry.  if you are like a few minutes over time, we wont worry 
about it.
