=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Drizzt's New Wiz Doc -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
(Note: This document does not override anything found in help
policy or help wizlevels.  You must read both of those files.
If you find a conflict, please ask the Day Admin about it.)

Ok, here is a list of rules and things U need to read.

1) Test Character - 
   It must be named your name+i    ex: drizzti
   Next you must add the character to /open/wiz_characters
   Do not use other players to test your areas!

2) Player Character -   
   Having a player character and a wiz at the same time is a
   privilage!  If you cheat both will be erased.  If you do not
   code anything and just play the wiz will be erased.  If you
   are a GM you can't have a wiz.  Only Elder level and above
   may have player characters. This must be added to
   /open/wiz_characters too!

3) Player interaction -
   To make it simple... DON'T interact with them.  You can talk
   to them and answer basic questions.  That is it!  Do not
   fix them, do not REIMB them, do not transport them, do not
   kill them, give them equip, etc.....

4) Admin -
   There is a help wizlevels that tells what admin are in charge
   of what, so U know who to go to.

5) Areas -
   Khojem is in charge of them, so talk to him about areas.
   Mikus must approve the project and approve the area before it
   gets coded and Khojem must approve the final code before it is
   put online.  Also in /doc/QC there is information on what is
   ok for areas... I.E. what is legal, what lvls to make monsters,
   etc... Also there are files in /doc/build on how to code the
   areas... You must submit an outline/story on how your area ties
   into the main story.  The main history is in ~mikus/history
   Example of a history is ~mythril/history.

6) Advancement -
   First you have to finish an area.  
   You will probably never be able to advance to arch level.

7) Progress Reports -
   You must keep a file in your dir called .project.  This
   file shows up in your finger like .plan does.  The format
   must be like mine.  finger drizzt to see it.  You must
   also put your current projet in /open/wiz_projects

8) Mentor -
   You must have a mentor.  If a mentor is not assigned to you
   when you are wizzed, then you must petition one to accept you.
   If you do not have a mentor, or your mentor recommends, you
   will be removed from the mud.  If you are stuck ask your mentor
   first (mail/tell) but if its pressing just yell over cre and
   someone will probably help you.

9) Web Page -
   Some wiz's have expressed intrest in making web pages for
   their areas... More power to them.  If you want to... do it.
   And Shadowraith will add a link to it from the Darke page.
   Also, if you have a personal page you want to add talk to
   Shadowraith.

10)LPC Format -
   Thou shall read /doc/lpc/basic and /doc/lpc/intermediate.
   These tutorials are a good start and refresher to some
   basic LPC coding.  Also, the format shown in them must
   be followed.  This includes indenting, /* remark sections
   and type declaration.  You do not need to /* remark each
   function, but if your code is hard to follow, read, or
   lacks function and variable type declarations, it will
   not be admitted into the mud.
