Recently I had the need to know when a particular monster
died at the hands of a player.  It is actually very easy to
do this, by adding the following code to the monster:
 
void die() {
   write_file("PATH AND FILENAME", "STRING");
   ::die();
}
 
I discovered that the function ctime() can be used to tell you
the exact moment of the monster's death.  You would also include
this in the STRING:
 
   ctime(time());
 
This function call actually records the date and time of death.
My lich's die() code looks like this:
 
void die() {
   write_file("/wizards/duridian/logs/lich.log",
      "Lich died at "+ctime(time())+".");
   ::die();
}
 
 
If you have any questions, feel free to send me mudmail or to
give me a tell if you catch me online.
