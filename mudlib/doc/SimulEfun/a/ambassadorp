Nightmare IV SimulEfin: ambassadorp()

int ambassadorp(object);

DESCRIPTION
Checks to see if an object is a member of the mud's ambassador group.
Be careful about placing people in the ambassador group, as
ambassador priveledges override all others.  The purpose for this
is to restrict the trouble an ambassador could possibly cause.
Thus if someone is in the arch group and the ambassador group,
their ambassador priveledges will override.
