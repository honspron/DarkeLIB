A document for the easy use of containers.
Written for the Nightmare Mudlib by Descartes 221092

This is the basic build document for the file /std/bag_logic.c, which is
a file that allows you easily to make bags, treasure chests, and other
sorts of objects.  The first part is a list of necessary functions you must
call in the container item.  The second part is about nifty functions which
can add individuality to your things.

******************************************************************************

Must call:
----------

set_name(), set_id(), set_short(), set_long(), set_weight(), set_value()
	It is assumed that the immortal reading this document understands
	these basic functions of object coding.  They are the same for all
	objects.

*****

set_max_internal_encumbrance(1200);
    This is how much weight the container can hold at most.

*****

Those are all the functions that must be called in order to create such an
object as a bag.  But it is rather uninteresting, and does nothing but allow
you to put things in and get things out.  Of course, down below, there are some
functions which make for an interesting container.

*******************************************************************************

Optional functions:
-------------------

*****

set_possible_to_close(1);
	This makes the container closeable and openable.
	Note that the container is created open.  You have to call the function
	toggle_closed() in order to close it.

*****

toggle_closed();
	This toggles the container that has been set closeable between
	open and closed.  If you want a container to start out closed, you have
	to call this either in the create() function or from the room which
	created the container.

*****

set_lock("locked");
	This function does 2 things.  First it makes the container lockable.
	Second, it sets the container at start either locked or unlocked,
	depending upon which string you pass as an argument.

*****

set_key("orc_treasure");
	This function sets the id of the object to be used in unlocking
	the container.  It should never be anything like "key", or
	"silver key", since you only want one key to open your lock.

*****

set_property("magic hold", 10);
	This is something generally done by a magic spell cast by a player,
	but if you want to make the lock a little harder for a rogue to pick
	a lock, you set a value to this property.  When a rogue tries to pick
	a lock, this value simply is subtracted from the players locks skill,
	such that is the player has a 50 in locks, then the player has a
	40% chance of picking the lock instead of the normal 50% for that
	skill level.
