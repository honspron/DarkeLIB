--------------------------------------------------------------------------
conjuration             Making stuff.  This includes summoning stuff,
			shooting stuff out your hands, and just about anything
			that requires bringing material into being.

illusionism		Like conjuration, except what you are making isn't 
			there!
			Also used to create illusions, like light, 
			darkness, disguise, etc.

elementalism		Spells of the elements.  See Drizzt on elemental
			stuff, and see Diewarzau before coding any
			elemental spells cuz they're kinda special.

magery			A basic magic skill, deals with summoning 
			creatures, and some protective auras.

sorcery			Spells which affect magic.  Counter-spells,
			spell shields, meta-spells, utility spells,
			and some very rare summonings.

prayer			Clerical magic.  Most healing and protection
			fall under here.

nature lore		Spells of nature.  Druids cast these.  Examples:
			puritfy water, speak with plant, etc.

body alteration		Spells which alter the body, can be harmful or
			helpful.  Growth, Haste, Limb Regeneration,
			Giant Strength, etc.
chaos magic		The magic of chaos?  Yes, spells that alter
			things in often harmful ways, do lots of
			damage, etc.
necromancy		Spells of the dead!  Kinda the "opposite" of prayer.
			may involve summoning, draining, damaging, etc.
enchantment		The skill of the enchanter.  Involves
			permanent and temp. enchantments.
