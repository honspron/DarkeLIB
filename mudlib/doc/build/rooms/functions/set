Nightmare Mudlib lfun: set()
Object: /std/room.c

void set(string what, mixed value);

This sets the value "value" to the key "what".
For example, set("short", "An empty room"); sets the short description of
a room.  This is used for some standard mud uses, but also may be used
by the coder to create their own settable and queryable values without
having to create a new variable or any new functions.
Current standard mudlib set keys:

"short": gives the room a short description for when the player is in brief mode

"long": gives the room a long description for when a player is in verbose
    mode.  Carriage returns should not be placed in the short descriptions
    or in the long descriptions of rooms, as the mud automatically wraps
    room descriptions to fit in the player's screen.

"night long": Sets up an alternate long description used only during the night.

"day long": Sets up an alternate long description used only during the day.

"long func": If you have your own criteria for deciding among different tyoes
    of long descriptions, you can set up a function to be called in your room
    code.  The function you define should return a string which will be used
    as the room's long description for that moment
