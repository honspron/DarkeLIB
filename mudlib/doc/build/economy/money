Each domain of Nightmare has its own legal tender for currency.
The legal currency of the main town of Praxis is gold coins.  No other
type of money is accepted in the main town, although the main bank
will exchange among all types of currencies.  Other domains may accept
only 1 of the following platinum, electrum, gold, silver, copper.
The default values set up by BALANCE will be set up in terms of gold coins.
You must set_value on all objects in gold coins.  But your pubs and shops
will convert that value into the currency of your domain.
To put money on a monster... monster->set_money("gold", 1000);
	this will give the monster 1000 gold coins.
Tou put it in a room, 
	money = new("/obj/coins");
	money->set_money("platinum", 2);
	money->set_money("copper", 3000);
	money->move(this_object());

	this will move a pile of 2 platinum coins and 3000 copper coins into the room.

See the balance document on money to learn what legal amounts are.
The exchange rate is as follows

1 platinum = 10 gold = 100 electrum = 500 silver = 1000 copper
