Okay, here are a few cursory guidelines for development cost of skills
and spells:

Skills:
Crappy skill (e.g., weapon skills, skills that do not pertain directly
to character advancement)
   dev: about 2-7
   fast: 2-2.5 times dev

Decent skill (anything that gives a decisive advantage in combat, or can
be used to otherwise advance the character)
   dev: 11 - 24
   fast dev: 2.5-a little over 3 times dev

Good skill (serious combat advantage or allows serious advantage over
other players)
   dev: 25-35
   fast dev: AT LEAST 3 times dev


Spells:

A good ground rule here is based on the level of the spell...so what level
should spells be...look at existing spells for this.

A good ground rule: for a basic spell, 5 times the spell level for dev,
	3 times that for fast.
