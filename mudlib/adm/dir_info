/adm

The mud's secure directory



Only mud administration, the top administration, should have access to

this directory.  People with access to this directory can screw up

the mud, since no matter what other access you gave them, they casn

get access to the whole mud just in virtue of having access to this dir.

Ideally, only objects in /adm/obj would have Root access.  Since this

security system is relatively new, however, /adm/daemon retains

Root access for the time being.  In truth, the only object on the mud

which needs Root access under this security system is the master object.

I left login.c with Root for the sake of simplicity, and simul_efun

object always acts as if it were root anyways.  



The directory is subdivided as follows:



/adm/daemon:

Secure daemons.  These do not need Root access, but they do need the sort

of access that can screw the mud up if misused.  For example, the banish

objects, if misused, could prevent admins from logging in.



/adm/db:

Secure databases.  These are databases no one but admins should have access to.

A good example here is the access.db which determines what access

different euid's have.



/adm/etc:

A special junk directory just for the arches.  You can store stuff in

there away from prying eyes.



/adm/include:

The mud include directory.  Again, access here means you can do things

like redefine euid Root and such.



/adm/obj:

Objects needing root access.



/adm/save:

A save directory for data which should not be readable by the general

populace.



/adm/simul_efun:

All the simul_efun code is stored here, modularly, so that adding and

removing simul_efuns is simple.
