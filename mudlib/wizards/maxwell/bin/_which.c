Usage: which <command>

The which command will search your aliases and then your path for the
specified command.  If it's an alias, it will tell you what the command
is aliased to.  And if it's found in your path, it will tell you in
which directory the command is defined.  If the particular command
is an add_action, the "localcmd" command should be used to determine
the name of the object defining it.

NOTE: The alias search capability was removed in the
port to DarkeMud due to compatibility problems.

See also: commands, localcmd.
