Area:                Under'Drin Mining Complex
Wizard:              Maxwell
Description:

100+ room High-mortal area, partying recommended in general combat and in
attempting to solve the quest. I added lots of 'little' things to get
away from the total 'hack'n slash' that is usually found in areas.
Some features are 4 types of exit traps that can be detected/disarmed
by players, moving mine cart system that moves carts around the mine
and another cart system that allows you to ride in a cart through part
of the mine, wall panels with ascii art puzzles to control carts,
ascii wall safe puzzle and I'm currently using a moving mob-aggressive
system that keeps track of current live/dead ratios to insure that the mine
is not filled or totally empty of mobs, advanced random equipment generator
for all mobs, and some unique mobs. I'm sure there is more..I just can't
think of anything else

World Map Location:  35_13
Area Entry:          Camp exit from world map

Mobs:   99% of mobs are aggressive using a random equipment generator
for all equipment. Generator will search for matching equipment in the
current mob room and use it if found instead of creating new stuff. Idea
was to keep the amount of extra shit laying around to a minimum. All mobs
are 20+ in level, most casting heal/harm at 6 level cast

Quest:   Quest is based on the search for the Lost Axe of Montar. The
axe was seperated into three parts and moved to a secret temple by the
Mage Venkart during a seige of the city, under order of the Duke of Montar.
The mine complex was dug into a mountain and just happens to be very close
to the temple, which is deep inside. Players will have to
use mine carts,wall panels and communicate with several mobs for information
and necessary equipment to reach the temple. Once the player enters the
quest area, they must communicate with Venkart, a quest-master type of
mob, and defeat three high-level guardian mobs. After each mob is defeated
the player recieves a piece of the Axe of Montar. It was split
into 3 pieces, a gold blade, a silver blade and a steel shaft. After
the player has all 3 pieces he must assemble the axe in the center of
the temple using 3 columns that create the Axe. The Axe is a 'unique'
weapon and there will be at most 1 in the game at all times. Once a player
has completed the quest he cannot enter the quest temple again. The
Axe, once assembled by a player, will have 1 owner. This owner can
keep the axe and use it as a weapon or turn it in a later date
to another mob in the zone for possible Quest Points. As far as
the reward for turning it in goes..it isn't coded yet. But the important
thing is that once 1 Axe is in the game, no other player can enter the
quest temple. They get a message saying that 'Until the Axe of Montar
is returned to the Dwarves, no one may enter here. It is rumored that
Mr X has the axe etc'. This way the players can tell who has the axe
and can pressure them to turn it in to the Dwarves so that others
may complete the quest. Once the Axe is turned in the quest temple
allows anyone who has not comleted the quest to enter.
