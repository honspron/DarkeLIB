Want shop that sells powder or other explosive
The check will look for the cannon to be loaded
If the cannon is not loaded then player may load assuming they have powder
Time delay will loading the cannon? Maybe send start message and then end message
So there would be serveral seconds of delay time between loading and compl.
Use fire command with a light fuse message
Would be nice to have messages sent to the rooms like a cannon ball flies over
Adjust sailing code? If I use the wind stuff it will be complicated
If I don't then how do I slow down the movemtn between rooms?
Maybe I shouldn't worry about it. If the players can move that fast on land
then why not that fast on water?
If I use the wind ideas to steer and move the boat I have to rely on a weather
system that is not coded yet.

What to make the other do..
1 Code water mobs
2 Code Ship mobs?
3 Code ship descs? Or extra ship rooms?

What is needed to get ships up and running?
1 Improve combat code
2 Solve sailing movement probs
3 Modify scanner
4 Solve object save problem
5 Build Ship Shops
