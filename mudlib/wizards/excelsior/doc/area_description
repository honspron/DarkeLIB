Area:
  New Faerie Dust
  
Wizard:
  Excelsior

Description:
  	A phase-implemented area in which this is the first. It is impossible 
  how I will divide my work up in the future. New Faerie Dust is a dark
  crime-ridden Gotham city type city but in the middle ages. The city recently
  elected a new mayor who proceeded to trash the city and declare himself
  dictator. The city is a densly populated area stacked together with no
  rhyme or reason. The first phase being implemented now contains the lower 
  level streets, a hospital, a theatre, shops, an information center, second
  level streets, the gnome farms, a prison facility and a sewer system.
  
Pathname:
  /wizards/excelsior/

World Map Location:
  /d/damned/virtual/room_16_20.world
  I got this spot reserved long ago by Mikus. It is already on the world map.
  The area has 1 exit room that exits to this location.

Area Entry:
  /wizards/excelsior/room/faeriedust.c
  World map should have a city gates description and
  "city" for entry.

Parts of the area:
	Theatre:
		To get into the jail you must go through the theatre. It also 
		contains several unwelcome guests to kill.
		
	gnome farms:
		This is a farm area built by the new mayor to farm gnomes. The
		gnomes' magic is used to control the city. It is very darke.
		
	sewers:
		A maze area inwhich the toaster king and many monsters are found.
		
	jail:
		Mae-tagg is held here.
		
	factory:
		To be added at a future date. It will make gas weapons the mayor
		plans to use to invade other areas of darke.
		
	power plant:
		The mysterious source of power for the city. Not yet coded.
		
	upperclass neighborhood:
		The home of a vital mage in the second quest. He will uncover
		the source of the evil in the city, but will need several things
		to do this which the player will have to collect. (Not yet coded)
		
Mobs:
  Most Mobs in the area are imobile and are from levels 1-20, but most are
  in the range of 9-15. Future additions will probably bring this number 
  up a little. Almost every critter has something on his or her person be
  it mone or equipment. There are maybe 2 that don't. This is to discourage
  the killing of these monsters. Monsters are in the file /wizards/excelsior/
  mon. Many of these monsters are quest related and only appear once, but others
  make several appearances. Shop owners are in /wizards/excelsior/rooms/shops
  except for /wizards/excelsior/mon/guy.c who runs the theatre snack bar. 
  Many monsters have spells.
  
  Monsters that have information to give and are communicated with via standard
   npc communication (with the exception of mother.c, baby.c and orderly.c) are:
   	
   	~mon/bertha.c
   		She is the theatre manager and gives informatino on the many problems of
   		her theatre. Little relavance to any quest.
   	
   	~mon/clown.c
   		He complains of being fired from the theatre and gives away a 
   		free ticket to the theatre. Evnetually when my second and major
   	    quest is added it will turn out that this clown is the evil behind
   	    all the troubles in the city and will transform into a level 20 
   	    sword-demon. Killing him will be the completion of the quest. 
   	    The transformation has not been coded yet and currently is 
   	    unattackable.
   	
   	~mon/ent
   		He is very wise and can be asked questions about various things 
   		in the city. The info gives clues to quest solutions.
   		
   	~mon/gnome_king
   		This character sends you on the quest to find and kill the source
   		of evil that is destroying the city. This is the only part of
   		my second quest currently coded and being loaded.
   		
   	~mon/mae-tagg
   		Bring him to the toasterking completes a quest.
   	
   	~mon/mother
   		The mother will give you her child (baby.c) to take to the doctor
   		(orderly.c). The orderly must be bribed. If you do so she will 
   		give you a key to the gnome farms.
   	
   	~mon/toaster_king
   		He sends you off to find his captured partner mae-tagg. If you
   		do so he will reward you with a quest and with access to the
   		New Faerie Dust Factory (not coded). The completion of this 
   		quest will be needed to complete the second.
   	

Quest:
  The toaster king hides out in the sewer system. He lives in ~rooms/
  sewer_workroom. He is running from the law because he is a freedom
  fighter. His partner, Mae-tagg, is held in the prison. If mae-tagg
  is brought back to the toasterking, the quest has been completed.
  The quest object is /wizards/excelsior/mae-tagg_quest.c and will
  require a copy to /d/damned/quests. The solution to the quest can
  be found in /wizards/excelsior/doc/quest1_solution
  Another quest will be added at a later time. (see above)

Weapons:
  Several weapon-types are loaded into this area.  They can all be wielded
  by anyone regardless of there skill with it. Currently the best weapon
  is at quality 5, though at a later date a 6 will be coded. All weapons
  are in /wizards/excelsior/weapons
  
Armor:
  Many armor items are loaded in this phase. The best current ac is around
  15 and is worn by a level 13 monster. Armors are found in: 
  /wizards/excelsior/armor

Misc Objects:
  /wizards/excelsior/obj contains various objects required for the area.
  The bag is a container. The crystals are alternatives to torches that
  can be recharged with mps. Curtain_obj is an object just for fun
  found in the theatre. With the doctors_note.c you can get the farm_key
  from the mother. explosive.c, transporter.c, leveler.c and fixer.c are
  all special items carried by ~mon/sewer_cow.c's. tt_mpaper is a music 
  paper (see below). lesser_explosive is a less powerful versoin of
  explosive that can be bought at the magic shop. Sceptre is held by
  the toaster_king and can create a pet. The rest are keys or simple
  tresure objects. /wizards/excelsior/emporium contains several signs
  and other reading tools found in the Excelsior Emporium. (see below)
  
Added Notes:
  The Excelsior Emporium
  	sw n from the entrance, this I plan to make a social center for my
  	area. Currently it contains announcement and information areas, but
  	I plan to add a casino and level 1 & 2 only small newbie zone in
  	the very near future.
  	
  The organ
  	down from the center stage in the theatre is a large pipe organ. On this
  	organ you play several songs to get cash rewards. (it is kind of an 
  	Indiana Jones safe mechanism type thing.) The current songs are
  	twinkle twinkle little star and ba ba black sheep, but more can be added
  	by changing the #define at the top of the code. Throughout the area I
  	have and will place music papers with the notes of these songs. To read
  	them you will have to bring the paper to a bard which will be on the
  	3rd level of the city. This will be coming soon.
  	
  The drain pipe
  	To get to the jail you must climb up a drain pipe on the outside of the
  	theatre. If you stay on this pipe to long you will fall to a small room
  	below. There is a hidden add_action to get out of this room. There is
  	a negative add_hp. The room below has no obvious exits, but there is a
  	way out: enter hole. This can be discovered by reading the long.
