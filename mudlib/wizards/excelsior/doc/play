The following is an excert from the wonderful play "Rosencrantz and 
Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard


Ros: We could play at questions.
Guil: What good would that do?
Ros: Practice!
Guil: Statement! One-love.
Ros: Cheating!
Guil: How?
Ros: I hadn't started yet.
Guil: Statement. Two-love.
Ros: Are you counting that?
Guil: What?
Ros: Are you counting that?
Guil: Foul! No repititions. Three-love. First game to ...
Ros: I'm not going to play if you're going to be like that.
Guil: Whose serve?
Ros: Hah?
Guil: Foul! No grunts. Love-One.
Ros: Whose go?
Guil: Why?
Ros: Why not?
Guil: What for?
Ros: Foul! No synonyms! One-all.
Guil: What in God's name is going on?
Ros: Foul! No rhetoric. Two-one.
Guil: What does it all add up to?
Ros: Can't you guess?
Guil: Were you addressing me?
Ros: Is there anyone else?
Guil: Who?
Ros: How would I know?
Guil: Why do you ask?
Ros: Are you serious?
Guil: Was that rhetoric?
Ros: No.
Guil: Statement! Two-all. Game point.
Ros: What's the matter with you today?
Guil: When?
Ros: What?
Guil: Are you deaf?
Ros: Am I dead?
Guil: Yes or no?
Ros: Is there a choice?
Guil: Is there a God?
Ros: Foul! No non sequiturs, three-two, one game all.
Guil (seriously): What's your name?
Ros: What's yours?
Guil: I asked you first.
Ros: Statement. One-love.
Guil: What's your name when you're at home?
Ros: What's yours?
Guil When I'm at home?
Ros: Is it different at home?
Guil: What home?
Ros: Haven't you got one?
Guil: Why do you ask?
Ros: What are you driving at?
Guil (with emphasis): What's your name?!
Ros: Repetition. Two-love. Match point to me.
Guil (seizing him violently): WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
Ros: Rhetoric! Game and Match! (Pause.) Where's it going to end?
Guil: That's the question.
Ros: It's all questions.
