Surviving in New Faerie Dust- Excelsior's guide for NFD Newbies

	So, you've decided to test your might against the creative 
mudding genious of Excelsior? Well, good luck. Here are just a
few things to remember when searching this massive city.

Read all the longs!

		There is so much hidden stuff in this area it is
	hard to believe. If you go through my area without
	reading any of the long descriptions I toiled night 
	and day over, you will end up missing about 3/4 of my
	area. Almost every other room has something special in
	it, and if you don't read the longs, you will miss these
	secrets.

Watch your level in the city!
		
		Basically,  the higher in the city you go,  the harder
	the monsters will get.  If you are below level 5, well you
	better just stick to the Emporium. This level was designed
	for levels 10+, with monsters going all the way up to level
	20. If you are a newbie, watch out. I plan to put a newbies
	only area attached to this emporium. It will be up in the
	near future, so look for it.
	
Talk to monsters!
	
		Many monsters in this area are quest related. (For quest
	info, see quest shop in Akkad.) All of these monsters can be
	talked to. To begin a conversation with such a monster, type
	'say <monster name>,<command>' The opening command is almost
	always 'hi' or 'help'. There should be hints to what it is in
	the monsters long description. There are 2 exceptions to this
	rule of conversation, and it should be clear from these mob's
	longs how to interact with them.
	
Map your route!

		I firmly believe that mapping your way as your travel through-
	out my area will make your journey infinitely easier. I spent long
	hours planing out my area in a 'possible' manner. (i.e. there are no 
	second level rooms over a out side room on the lower level.) I would
	hope that you could appreciate the layout of my area as much as me.
	Mapping will make your journeys in mazes much easier as well. Though
	rumor has it there is a store somewhere in the city that sells maps,
	you can always make your own for free.
