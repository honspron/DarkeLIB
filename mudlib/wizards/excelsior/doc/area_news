%^RESET%^Area changes:

I have made some major changes in the New Faerie Dust program code
to make it compatible with the new Security system.

%^BLUE%^NONE OF THESE CHANGES SHOULD AFFECT THE PLAYER IN ANY WAY.
%^RESET%^That's right, the average player should not notice anything different.

If, when traveling the city, you get a bug message that wasn't there
before or notice anything different whatsoever, please alert me at once.
(or a bug message that was there before)

Thank you.
