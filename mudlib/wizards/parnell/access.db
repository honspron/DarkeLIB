# /adm/etc/access.db
# from the Nightmare Mudlib
# Database file for determining euid and group access
# system created by Descartes of Borg 01 august 1993
# based on security ideas by Cygnus@Synergy
#
# file format should look like this:
# (directory): (all)[permissions] (group1)[permissions]
# and on and on until you have defined proper permissions for everyone
# all sets the general default permissions
# permissions come in the following forms: w, r, rw, wr, or n
# meaning write access, read access, or read and write access
# n means no access
