                    Wizard Levels and Responsibilities

God Wizard - (Diewarzau, Drizzt, Shadowraith, Zortek)
The God Wizard position is responsible for all that occurs on the mud.
Any God level may instruct any other wizard in any matter concerning
the mud.  Currently we are operating with a Triumvarate system with
Drizzt, Shadowraith and Zortek operating together.  Diewarzau shall
not be disturb.  The buck stops with the Tri.  Please do not try to 
go behind one God's back to another, we talk to each other and it
will aggravate your situation.  God Wizards have all file access and
site access as well.

    Drizzt is responsible for everything.  He is the appeals God.
    He handles overall Mud Balance and has final say on change of
    Theme or Direction.  You may contact Drizzt if you disagree with
    a decision rendered by the Day Admin.

    Shadowraith is the Day to Day operations God.  He is the initial
    contact point for all player disputes that cannot be handled at
    a lower level.  He monitors for player/wiz cheating and abuse and
    approves all new wizards.  He is also responsible for the WWW page.

    Zortek is the Security God.  He is responsible for core coding and
    tracks down severe bugs that cannot be handled at a lower level.
    Do not approach him with player disputes since he prefers to remain
    out of politics and just code.

    Diewarzau is responsible for core coding.  He is outside the loop
    and not to be contacted with problems unless one of the Tri tell
    you to mail him.  Leave him alone lest you suffer in purgatory
    forever and ever amen.  From him all good things flow.  Diewarzau
    may of course change policy/theme/direction at any time, but for
    the most part he will be outside the daily admin flow.
