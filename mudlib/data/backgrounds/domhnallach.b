Domhnallach, one of the sprites from the fabled Highlands of the north.  Like many of their kin he takes his name from his family name, MacDomhnallach.  In rare moments he speaks out against the injustices of his home, his story goes like this :-

Domhnallach grew up in a small holding called Duncgaidheald, which means Home of The Highlanders, at the southern pass to the highlands, living amongst the hills in the great pines the area is famous for.  For years they had lived amongst the friendly 'big people' who also lived there, most of them humans, but also some giants and goblins.  That is until the great invasion, the lands south of the area were populated by an empire of of aggressors who had enslaved many other lands, now it was time for his land.

The Roundheads, called so for the strange helmets they wore with their battle uniforms, outnumbered the Gaidheals by more than 10 to 1. Tens of thousands of Gaidheals died in defending their homelands, their efforts brave but futile.

After the invasion the roundheads began to wear everyone down, making laws punishable by death, banning the Gaelic language, the national dress Te Bheag Chuilt, the common weapons such as those used while hunting and fishing.  They kept up with this oppression until the Clearances, this most heinous form of ethnic cleansing.  People were chased and burned out of their homes so the roundheads could use the land to give to those Gaidheals who had treacherously assisted the Roundheads in the invasion to raise livestock for their expanding empire, those who didnt leave were murdered until only a few were left to tend the livestock like slaves.

During this time Domhnallach fled west accross the seas, then south to escape the memories of his murdered friends and family.  He eventually arrived at Akkad, meeting the Gromek Demerick he realised that the study of the ancient art of enchanting, imbueing weapons and armour with magical properties would be a way for arming an elite army of Gaidheals to take back the land which was once theirs...  As with most things about this Gaidheal, you cant help but feel he is fighting with futility once more.
